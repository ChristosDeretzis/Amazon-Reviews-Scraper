0,"Leason learned with this one.  I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.  After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.  She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.  When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.  She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.  Don't do it.  It's not worth it.  Just get a new phone.",1
1,"The camera doesn’t work, neither does the flash light. This has been a problem since unpacking the item. Eventually, both would work after resetting and restoring my iPhone but would then stop after a few days.I have dealt with this issue for over a month. Initially, I tried calling the seller multiple times and have left a voice message. Never heard from them. So I am now stuck with a faulty phone that works on its own terms.The seller was Lonestar Mobile.",1
2,Package arrived on time. But the phone was not unlocked as advertised,1
3,"after I used this phone, it have some problems.it will automatically restart when I use it,especially charging.i was scared,because i have no extra money to change another phone.i was bothered by this problem.",1
4,"Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.",5
5,I should be able to give zero stars. This is a scam. The phone I got is faulty and the charger never worked. I have to spend money to get it fixed and I have to buy a charger. I am reluctant to spend money to get it fixed because it might still not work. I am stuck with a useless piece of crap.,1
6,"COMPRE UN IPHONE 8 DE 256 GB TAL COMO ESTA EN LA PUBLICACION Y EN EL RECIBO DE COMPRA Y ASI ME LO COBRO. PERO CUANDO ME LO MANDO ERA UN IPHONE 8 DE 64 GB, CUYO VALOR OBVIAMENTE ES MENOR.ES UN PESIMO VENDEDOR, UN ESTAFADOR... TENGAN CUIDADOSI ALGO DE DECENCIA LE QUEDA QUE ME DEVUELVA EL VALOR DE LA DIFERENCIA.",1
7,The screen was too dark even with brightness at 100% the screen didnt look the way is supposed to,1
8,"I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!",5
9,"iPhone didn't come in original packaging and with original accesses. Which was expected. Had couple very minor scratches, which is expected as well. It was fully unlocked (I have tested it). IMEI was not reported lost/stolen ether. Overall it's quite nice and for a good price.",5
10,"The whole side of the phone is cracked and is obviously in bad condition, I do not recommend this to anyone.",1
11,These cannot possibly be certified refurbished as stated. Both phone batteries were so dead when I received them it took a day to charge. One phone has a camera that does not work.,1
12,"I bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and I try to contact the company but no response, I contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back,  i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back (I Was waiting a day because I wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one) I would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money. I contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return, suggesting I take it to a ""repair shop"" and have them look at it. It freezes constantly and the volume doesn't work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation.",1
13,"I’ve had this phone for just over two weeks now, and I haven’t had any issues with it (:::knock on wood:::). My carrier is T-Mobile, so connecting to the network was as simple as transferring my sim card from my dinosaur 5s to this phone. I feel like I got what I paid for, and I am satisfied with my purchase.",5
14,Was told by Customer Service there was no way to unlock the phone and that it was GSM unlocked as stated. I contacted Apple who checked the number and found it was still registered to AT&T. I logged in and unlocked it from AT&T but this was not GSM unlocked. It was an AT&T phone. Hope the phone works better than Jem Jem's indifferent customer service.,1
15,Phone did not work on the Verizon network but the customer service through the return process was excellent!,4
16,we buy an unlocked iphone and to open the screen it is asking for a code! very bad service,1
17,"The phone was great I was a little worried because of the reviews but when i received the phone, it was great. The glass at the back is completely intact, there is 2 small scratches at the front that you can barely even see. The battery life was at 98% so this was an awesome deal for the money. Definitely worth buying",5
18,"Ignore all the bad reviews !I got my IPhone 8 Gold in the mail this afternoon and it was dent & scratch free. When I went into setting the battery storage is 100% and the battery life is great!It even came with an apple charger & and apple wall box. No dongle though.Amazing purchase, I’m so glad I bought it!",5
19,I just received the device and it came completely scratched up and had a crack in the screen located  near ear piece speaker.,1
20,"There were a few small blemishes on the back of the phone that were only noticeable if you look really close.  Otherwise no scratches, dent, or anything else customers mentioned on either of the two phones that I ordered.  It came with a real Apple charger not a knockoff and the phone itself worked perfectly.  I saved $200 over buying a new phone and am super happy.",5
21,"I’m so disappointed I bought 2 iPhone 8 64gb in GOLD as the description says. But I ended up with two rose gold phones. I had gotten these as gifts that I needed to give as the person is leaving today, so now two middle aged men will be proud owners of a rose gold iPhone! 😦",1
22,"Always afraid of refurbished products, but not bad at all wife hasn't complained yet lol its been over a year.",5
23,The description claimed that it would work on any network and specifically listed Sprint.  When I took it to the Sprint store to get a SIM card and get the phone activated they ran the IMEI and said it would not work on their network as it was GSM and not CDMA.I was disappointed that there was no selection for CDMA in the product options.Would not recommend as you may not get a phone that will work on your network.,1
24,2 month ago I have purchased above iphone 8 with 64gb. we received in good condition and it is totally dent and scratc. h free. so far working perfectly.,5
25,It's the best. It looks like a new one. All functions work well. Seller also sent me a screen protector. I strongly recommend it.,5
26,"I just received my phone yesterday and it works good and looks good. The reviews are correct, the Gold is the Rose Gold which is what I wanted! However, I have put in my Straight Talk SIM card and the data does not work. It says Verizon at the top and I've had an issue before buying a Verizon phone not working with my SIM card. I'm not sure what to do?",4
27,"After two bad IPhone purchases on Ebay, both refunded, and no luck finding a decent IPhone 8 on Gazelle I was hesitant to order another pre-owned IPhone. However, this IPhone was as advertised. Mint condition, excellent battery life and yes, it was actually an unlocked  model 1863. Dropped in my MetroPCS sim card and was up and running immediately. Good purchase and would buy again.",5
28,"Don't even think of buying this. I was badly scammed. First they only give you the phone and not even the chargers and others. Second, the phone did not even turn on. I have never been scammed this bad. This is literally the worst experience I have had with Amazon. Please save yourself and do not buy it. If you do, just come back here for a big fat I TOLD YOU SO",1
29,I am very very confused because I got an iPhone 11 Pro Max and not a red iPhone 8. But I don’t care it’s so much better,5
30,"The current phone I had was destroyed and I decided to  order a i8 phone rose gold unlocked, when I ordered it, I received a i7 phone white 😕, seeing that I needed a phone I decided to keep it and use it but then is was locked , I followed all the instructions that came with the phone which specifically said that the phone is unlocked, but the phone is LOCKED.....the reason I’m writing this review so late is because i have a friend that unlock phones and trying to unlock phones takes time, he unlocks the most difficult networks and this phone just can’t unlock , I’m going to return it. I’m very very disappointed 😡😡😡😡",1
31,"By reading some other reviews and based on my own experience I feel as though Kanga Supply, probably doesn't do a very intensive quality assurance on their products. If I could guess, they get a lot of refurbished used phones, which for the majority of the time work fine, but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty. The phone I received wouldn't even turn on, despite trying to charge it with 3 different chargers. I guess it's my fault for not looking at their website, where they make no guarantees that their products work. If you need a phone immediately, I wouldn't suggest buying from here, unless your willing to wait 3-4 business days for an exchange or refund.",1
32,"I should have known better- as soon as I tried to turn the phone on to set it up, there were problems. The phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home/power buttons.I finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence (I was mistaken) and began to set up the phone. The phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night. Again, I blamed it the amount of data I was transferring from my old phone. (mistaken again)I used the phone for a few days, and it reset or shut down probably an average of 5 times a day. Sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons, touching, or even my attempts to force it to shut down. I would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again.I ended up returning the phone, and asked to exchange it for one that worked. The company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead. Now I am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one. I will not be buying this phone ever again and I recommend that you don't either.",1
33,"I bought this phone with intention of switching my Sim card from my current phone, to this one since I already have AT&T. But when I when to get my Sim card switched at the store (since I also bought a case there as well) they told me it didn't work because the phone was locked. Very dissatisfied with my purchase.",1
34,"I usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new. I found this listing and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were. I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that I could be assured that this would be a good purchase. They were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and Apple.I received the product and it was in MINT condition. The phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever. It has been working perfectly for 4 months now, and I could not be happier with my purchase.The packaging clearly wasn't original and the charger was not OEM, but this is stated in the product description so I knew what I was getting into. No big deal.If you're the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about $100, this is an excellent option for you.Additionally, I had no problems switching this phone over on my Verizon account. As long as you are a Verizon customer, this should be an easy process through the Verizon app.Thanks!",5
35,"I was looking for a reasonably priced iPhone 8 and happened to stumble upon this phone. I was skeptical at first because it was the cheapest I could find anywhere online, however, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. The phone was advertised as a renewed phone that could vary on the degree of visual usage and battery health. Aside from one scratch on the back glass, the phone is flawless. The battery is also running at 100% capacity which was one of the most important categories for me when buying a new phone. I also checked the IMEI number and model number to find out more information. I was very happy to find that the phone was only 8 months old, and basically brand new with all original parts. This checked all the boxes and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. For any one that cares my order was fulfilled by CR Land, who has their orders fulfilled by amazon. You can feel safe knowing that if you have to return your item or have any issues you will be dealing with amazon directly. You will not be dealing with the store front who supplies the product which is a plus since amazons return process is relatively painless. I would definitely recommend this product to another person just make sure you watch the prices, they often change and you may miss out on a deal that is up to $40 less than what is usually offered.",5
36,"I actually accidentally ordered this product when I meant to only add it to a wish list. I contacted the seller and they agreed to work with me to return it, but I decided to actually keep it, but kudos to the seller for being great! The phone was in perfect condition. It came on a recent but not the newest version of iOS so I had to update it before using it. No dents or scratches anywhere, battery health was at 100% when I checked it too. It does not come in original packaging or with Apple cables to charge it or to connect 3,5mm audio cables. It does come with a MFi (Made for iPhone) ac power brick and lightning connector cable and a sim eject tool to help you change sim cards.I just want to share some insight about GSM vs CDMA models. This is a GSM model phone, however I am a Verizon customer-- which is a CDMA network. GSM model iPhones have all the LTE bands that Verizon uses (I think Verizon's main  LTE band is 13 or 14 if you want to look up compatibility  yourself). So even with a Verizon sim card in this GSM only phone, I can still access all of Verizons 4g networks and have phone and text service, as well as LTE and voice over LTE. If I ever go out in the middle of nowhere I won't be able to make calls likely because I won't have access to Verizon's CDMA bands, but it's just as good as any CDMA model for most peoples uses, just don't expect to have cell service while camping or in some state/ national parks if you are a Verizon customer. 4g and LTE is rolled out very wide so you shouldn't have any issues.",5
37,"I was extremely skeptical about going with the certified refurbished option but this company did not let me down. You can trust this purchase completely and I’m so glad I did. It saved me hundreds of dollars and this phone works perfectly. I might as well as bought it new, no scratches or noise deformations. I’m pumped.",5
38,"It is almost perfect...It takes a while to fully charge, but the battery lasts all day long, esthetically flawless.. not a single scratch.",5
39,"I received a defective phone. It arrived in good physical condition, but cannot be updated to the latest software version and no longer boots up. This is all within an hour of having receiving it.The return label I received from the seller requires that I pay for shipping!",1
40,"the phone was clearly defective. The touch screen did not work at all. This is extremely frustrating since I need a cell phone for work. This makes me question using Amazon when clearly defective products are shipped, apparently without assuring that the product is operational.",1
41,"I purchased this for my wife. I was VERY hesitant to purchase refurbished especially when you see reviews of phones not working at all or where product details warn against using phone with any carrier other then ATT. We use cricket, which uses ATT towers. Happy to report, phone arrived fast, condition was excellent (no dings, scrapes, scratches, or any physical damage whatsoever). Packaging was a repack ( not original box) but was re-wrapped, included new cable and charge block, phone was nearly charged to full. Included a nice screen protector. Setup was simple as new, no issues with transfer. My wife has been using for 3 days now and loves it (so far). Will update after 30 days but so far, very pleased and glad We purchased.**UPDATE** 30 days in and still no issues. Very satisfied customer",5
42,"Everything works fine on this device but I think the seller bugged it before shipping it because, I had hackers hack into my paypal and steal money, people trying to sell stolen cars off my offer up account, people attempting to login to my Instagram, gmail, etc. from Brazil, Asia... I also had somebody hack into my Spotify account and delete all my playlists and lock me out of the account I pay for. Overall not worth it. I’ve had to change my password for everything!!!!",1
43,"iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSMWhat came in the box1. iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM2. Lightning Cable3. USB Plug4. Original BoxWhat was not in the box1. Earphones2. SIM Card Removal Tool3. User ManualThe cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals.EarphonesHave always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker.Phone ConditionBody is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket.Screen ConditionIt came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine.A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside.It’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one I’ll never know, I guess some don’t care. I have a spare screen protector now.Battery Condition  Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup.Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV.Setting it upPhone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory.CameraNo scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp.SpeakersNo issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops.Microphone, Lighting PortNo issues. Works.Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree. Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who. It’s as if it was all sold by one seller.  Reviewers need to say who their seller was.My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most.  This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop. I don’t need the latest and greatest, a gently used phone is just as good.",5
44,Half of my calls are muffled and people cannot hear me talking.,1
45,"The phone came in great condition but I have one small problem. I had an android from metropcs before this iphone and I tried putting the Sim in this phone but it says ""no sim"" and wont make calls. I saw another review on here that said it works with metro pcs so I'm trying to figure out the problem.",4
46,The phone crashes all day at least 5 times a day and takes a long time to reboot. Looks fake.,1
47,"Have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great.  It is an iPhone 8, 64GB model.  It looks brand new and everything functions as it should.  A note to Straight Talk users.  That is my carrier and when I put my Straight Talk SIM card in this phone it works great but I went to the Straight Talk website and logged in so I could transfer my new phone and register it.  The website kept giving me an error when I entered the phone's IMEI or serial number so I called Straight Talk support.After working with me for a while, the rep said ""You can't use your current SIM card because you have an unlocked phone.  You are going to have to buy a new SIM card and then register that and the new phone with our ""Bring Your Own Phone"" system on the website.""  I asked if I did that could I keep my phone number and he said yes.  I did some research online and got the impression the the Bring Your Own Phone is not for existing customers, but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers.  Not sure about that, but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is, I am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new SIM and trying to register it with Straight Talk.  I think they don't want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the Straight Talk website or an authorized supplier so I am leaving well enough alone.  The phone works fine with my SIM card, the only thing is that on the Straight talk website it shows I have a Samsung Galaxy instead of an iPhone 8.  No harm, no foul.",5
48,"Seller was prompt and the phone was flawless. After a couple months, I have had no issues.",5
49,My husband is very happy with birthday present.,5
50,Este producto me llegó malogrado prende trabaja una hora y después se apaga por 4 o 5 horas después se vuelve a prender solo y hay veces no prende el producto viene fallado revísenlo,1
51,"iPhone came locked. We took it to T-Mobile who couldn’t do anything for us. We then took it to Apple, who offered to bypass the code. As they were working to bypass, the phone wouldn’t connect to the USB port. The Apple genius takes out a cleaner and starts unpacking gunk from the charging port. So, that was the moment I decided that we were sending this back. It was locked, it was packed with lint, it would not charge, and it has a visible scratch. So much for careful refurbishing.",1
52,"Took hours to reach 20% charge; must be a defective while the front and back has no scratch the rounded corner has dents. The phone has been dropped, which most likely lead to the charging issue.In package only the phone is original, plug and cable are oem and no instruction. No lightening to earphone jack adaptor.Read some of the reviews and people had same issues; hope this return isn’t going to someone else?",1
53,"I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.",5
54,"A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&T and T Mobile are compatible.I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.",3
55,Received a defective phone:1. The boot screen would display a line either above or below the Apple logo occasionally. It would either show as a green line or a static line2. There was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps. I compared it to a friends iPhone 8 and the problem was specific to the phone I received3. The touch screen would not respond occasionally4. The battery would not display correct percentages. I once had the phone charging for 20 minutes and the percentage did not increase at all. After restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage.  This also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone5. The speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iPhone 8,1
56,"I bought this twice, two years apart. The first one I sent back because the battery went south way too quickly and they sent another lickety split. Then I broke it fair and square.The one this time looks absolutely new with not so much as a smudge. Con: this battery health is at 77%, which is easily acceptable for a phone selling at 70% off the original price. A sixty dollar battery ""repair"" in a year is well worth it.Buy this one! If yours isn't perfect, SEND IT BACK FOR ANOTHER! Every used phone can have problems but that doesn't mean every used phone has one. If you don't understand this, go buy a new thousand dollar phone and be happy.",5
57,The phone literally cut off & on On me like 10 times also the call will drop and says called failed. It’s nice and new but the phone system seems to have its own issues,1
58,"The phone came as described in awesome packaging (as in, not just a cardboard box). The phone works great, it's fast compared to my iPhone SE, and was nearly flawless cosmetically. It had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs, but that was covered up by the case I purchased. Besides, cosmetics don't affect the performance of the phone.Something I was a little leery about was the description, so here's my experience: The phone I received was unlocked and works great with Ting. The description said unlocked, but some reviewers mentioned that they received a GSM phone, and I was looking for CDMA. I received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network. I purchased from BuySPRY. I hope they don't mind I mentioned them.It is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked. However, if the description specifies a specific network like ""unlocked GSM,"" then the phone will only work on GSM networks. Make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions. That's what I did and it worked out to my benefit.",5
59,"The product came with a scratch and little divet on the screen. When I first got it, it had a screen protector on, so I thought the screen protector had the divet- nope.  After accidentally dropping it, my phone screen cracked right through the divet. I have not had this phone long and am pretty disappointed as It is not even usable now. Now the screen shows many lines of colors. I should have sent it back at the beginning when I saw the divet but was willing to work with it. Make sure you do your due diligence when you first buy it to send it back if there is any issues with the screen!It’s a true unlocked Apple phone. Worked with at&t and Verizon (we switched carriers).",1
60,My phone was delivered in a timely manner and came in nice packaging. No scuffs or scratches on the screen or outside of the phone. I’m very content with the condition of this phone and it was easy to set up with the existing sim card I had in my old phone through Verizon! I will never buy a brand new phone from the store again! I do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port.,4
61,"I had a great experience with this purchase thus far. After reading some reviews about possible issues I was concerned and contacted seller. They responded quickly (10-20min) with multiple questions I had and related information about the T-Mobile only iPhone I had purchased and made me feel very comforable with the purchase. A+ customer service was my experience and the phone is in great shape for ""renewed"". Will update if needed. With phone and network carriers it pays to do a little homework sometimes.",5
62,"The phone arrived a day before; looked brand new; and worked perfectly... For the first 2 days. In just 2 days the screen has went black and stopped working. The phone is still on as it had 80% charge and it is vibrating when I touch the home button, but the screen does not work. I am now turned off by the whole experience as the phone looked perfect and stopped working out of nowhere.",1
63,"I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway. Just expect the worst but low-key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones.",2
64,"I ordered a red i8 to replace a i5. I was not expecting to be surprised by reading the reviews. It showed up in 3 days when I opened the box it looked like a new i8 I ordered the red one it was in perfect condition no scratches no dings, dents or scuffs It looks brand new. Set it up in no time every thing is working  flawlessly I’ve had it a few weeks and no issues yet. Will repost if anything goes wrong",5
65,"A month after it working perfectly fine, the system just crashed. I have returned it and I'm waiting for next is my refund.",4
66,"After paying a lot of money for a rush phone, I got it in and it has 2 large scratches on the screen.  I’m forced to keep it as I HAVE to have one for work so I paid for rush shipping and had to load all my stuff on it, but NOT worth this price with the scratched screen.",1
67,I purchased this IPhone 8 for my mother in law. The phone was in excellent condition and operated perfectly for two months. After two months of use she could no longer get service on the phone. After contacting T-Mobile it was revealed the there is a carrier block on the phone and it cannot be used because the previous owner never paid the phone off. Just be aware this could happen and verify that the phone is clear and unlocked.,1
68,"When I got the phone, I was disappointed, but not surprised by the 85% capacity battery inside. I expected I’d be taking it in to Apple for a battery replacement, anyway. But, when I took it to Apple, they couldn’t replace the battery. They showed me pictures, where there was standing water and corrosion inside. Needless to say, I was shocked. Not only did I have the phone in a waterproof case, I only had it for a few days, and NEVER had it near water. I immediately contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller. The seller asked if I’d submerged the phone. I couldn’t believe it. After a few days of emailing, they agreed to a refund. I asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation. I use the phone for work. I missed out on money. They said they couldn’t oblige that. But, they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone.",1
69,The iPhone I purchased actually was a stolen - and therefore blacklisted - one. I guess it's a common practice for this vendor to sell stolen iPhones.Amazon Renewed should probably be more careful of the provenance of the iPhones and should not take part in large-scale phone traffics.,1
70,This phone is great! However the next phone I got from this shop wasn’t so you really have to pray for the best. I will say they do refund you if there’s any issue. Their customer service is excellent! I just returned the defective iPhone 6S and purchased another iPhone 8 hoping that since I’m paying almost double that it will be exactly like this phone that I’m writing the review about.,5
71,"I was hesitant to order bc of how long it said it would take to arrive, however it arrived in less than a week (a whole week earlier than expected). I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the phone. Not one single scratch on the screen, rear glass surface, or camera lens. There were some small surface scratches on the paint close to the camera lens, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone. Other than that, it was in perfect condition. It is fully operational, and took the AT&T SIM card that I had when I first tried it. Where I’m located, Verizon is the way to go bc AT&T service sucks around here. When my Verizon sim arrived from straight talk, I popped it in and called the customer service line. She worked her magic and paired the phone’s IME number with the Verizon sim, and after about 20 minutes it was working perfectly on the Verizon sim. So when they say all carriers, it actually works on both AT&T and Verizon carriers.Also, I wasn’t even expecting a new cord and charger, but there it was in the box. I was also expecting to have to go find a paperclip to install my sim, but low and behold they included the sim removal tool too! For a 256Gb phone that is unlocked on all carriers, I’m extremely impressed. The battery had about 80% capacity, which is great too.I’m excited to have a shiny new phone, and I didn’t have to pay an arm and a leg to one of the big cell companies or sign and contract to get it! I’m all about not signing cell contracts these days. So thank you for having great quality phones for purchase! I will purchase from them again in the near future when it’s time for me to upgrade once again",5
72,"I do like writing reviews especially for used phones because it helps everyone. A special shout out to the Synergy phone renewal program team. My iPhone 8 came in perfect condition with the battery capacity of.....99%, really. When I ordered this phone last week I was having second thoughts about needing an iPhone just for work as I already have a iPhone 12mini but didn't want to use it for both personal and work so I took a chance and went with the 8, I was going to get a 7 but the 8 is only $15 more. I kind of hoped it would have some scuffs and that the battery was at 70 something percent capacity  so I could send it back and just use my 12 mini but I don't want the wear and tear on that battery alone as the 12 mini already has a small battery. I told myself the phone would need to be perfect and I would keep it, well perfect it was. I have ordered a Samsung galaxy s8, and it had screen burn in as well as a galaxy s9 plus that had a swollen battery (NOT FROM SYNERGY) so used phones can be hit or miss but this iPhone is brand new just in a different generic box but it came with the official iPhone cable and charging brick, all for $170.00 + tax. So yes I am keeping this for work and am as happy as I will ever be from a used phone, thank you Synergy, you all rock.",5
73,I needed to replace my old iPhone 5S because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera.  The iPhone 8 was priced right and I'm very happy with it.  The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.  My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.  I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.,5
74,This phone did not work! It did turn on the first day and it overheated within 2 hours. The phone had a crack and after the first day the phone wouldn't  turn off and the calibration was off. It couldn't  read the password  to get into the phone. I will never buy a phone from this company again!,1
75,"I purchased this phone to use overseas on small trip, while i was on the airport decided to try and use it, put a T-Mobile SIM and it didn't work! Worst of all it was sunday and the seller Kanga Supply wasn't available.I arrived at my destination country on sunday , put a local SIM card and voilá! It's working!Later i asked a friend and he told me this happens a lot with US carrier locked phones which at some point get unlocked, they don't work with US SIM cards.Phone is working fine after 5 days and is in great aesthetic conditions. Haven't tried headphones because it didn't come with any accesories besides a generic charger and SIM tool.I think the seller or Amazon should put this warning on the product page.",4
76,"Purchased for my mother and received a glass screen protector already on it. Phone works exceptionally well, and was relieved that it was so perfect. Just wish it came with headphones. But the buy was worth it vs buying from a retail phone store.",5
77,This is a great product that arrived very timely and looks great!!,5
78,After 3 months my keyboard doesn’t work well:((,2
79,"The phone initially worked just fine and I was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier. A few hours later, however, I realized I wasn't getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps. While trying to make a test phone call, I was redirected to my carrier's customer service line. The representative informed me that the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number had been blacklisted as lost/stolen and that I would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either Apple or Verizon (the former carrier). This is unacceptable considering I paid for a fully unlocked phone. On top of that, the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly. Phone calls are nearly unintelligible and music quality sounds worse than my iPhone 5s. I am very disappointed overall with this ""Renewed"" product that Amazon stands behind.",1
80,"I specifically sought this US-based model number A1863: it is listed as such.  Awesome.  I instead received a Japanese version model A1902 (apple p/n MQ782J/A).  Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?  After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.  I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.  If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.  That is why I am taking off one star from this review.To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.  All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.  I've had it for several weeks, with no hiccups.AppleCare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as 88%, but this is obviously a used phone.  Still a good value for me.",4
81,Product is working well and in perfect condition. Packaged nicely. Also came with a charger,5
82,this says fully unlocked but when I called boost mobile to switch phones they said they cannot be used with boost mobile.  very disappointed because the phone is great looking.  I ordered a different iPhone 8 fully unlocked and I hope that I don't have the same problem,1
83,"I didn't pay attention and assumed that this was amazon refurbished so I didn't read the reviews. I have only been using the phone for a few hours because it took over 3 hours to charge the phone to 80%. when I check the battery maximum capacity it is at 80% not what I would expect from a ""refurbished"" phone.  I am also getting some weird behavior with the Bluetooth it has been dropping connection with my car off and on. I am going to keep checking thing out but may return it if things keep going this way.",1
84,"I gave this phone a 1 only because the seller is not describing it properly.  It is a gsm phone and, as such, does not work on Verizon or Sprint the same way a Verizon or Sprint phone will work.  Those carriers use CDMA phones, so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage.  It worked in as far as I could get it activated to make calls, receive texts and be fully functional, but only in certain areas.  I had an iPhone6 & an iPhone 4 before that, both with Verizon & both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend's house & never once lost service in 6 years.  Then I bought this phone & had service fine until I got to his house & then my phone said ""no service"".  It did this repeatedly for a few days every time I went to his house & stayed that way the whole time I was there even though my boyfriend's Verizon iPhone 8 worked in the same house at the same time & never lost service.  I called Verizon & they said this phone was a T-Mobile phone & is a gsm phone & explained that if I want the same level of coverage I had before I need an unlocked phone that was originally a Verizon phone so that it is a CDMA phone.  I guess an original Sprint phone would work, too, since those are CDMA phones.  I told Amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or CDMA.",1
85,"The camera sound (the “click” when you take a picture) cannot be muted, not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the Silent Mode. I went to the Apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired, but they said no: they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from Japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced. I found it extremely disappointing, as I would have never bought it if I knew in advance – and I am very surprised that this is an Amazon “certified and inspected product”: did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted? At least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off.As a loyal customer of Amazon (Prime too) from several years now, I found it extremely shady: you sponsor a product as certified and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications, given that Amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world. I am based in the USA and knowing that the product would have come from Japan and the camera cannot be silenced, I wouldn’t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier.This is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by Amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process.Lastly, the battery is weak – it lowers down very quickly and I have to charge it at least three times a day.",1
86,The phone screen is acting up. You can’t slide to answer when phone is locked and letter T and number 5 don’t work on the keyboard. Then the phone will eventually start tweaking and typing all the Ts as shown on the video. I will keep the phone for a few more days and see how it goes before I decide to return it,3
87,"Phone arrived on time, and looked completely new.  Was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected.  After two weeks, if I was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions.  Initially I thought I had been hacked, but I read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty.  Unfortunately this happened  while I was on vacation, so I ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever I was out of the house.  It also deleted all my music (which I was able to re load when I returned home).  It then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once I returned home, so I was without a mobile phone for several weeks.  I have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem.  I intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone I want, it did look perfect, the battery life seems good, and the price is very good.",2
88,"Upon opening the box there is a packet of information with ""Open me first"" on it.  If you do that the set up is flawless.  Once you turn on your new/used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings, address book and apps in a matter of minutes, it could not have been any easier. You then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it's ready to use. On the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least 90% or better, to my surprise it's at 100%.  The iphone itself looks like it's a new phone, not a scratch on it, it even has a month or so left on the original Apple warranty from whoever owned it before.  I've been wringing it out, texting, taking pics, making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone 6 plus didn't have and so far so good.  While I liked the bigger screen on the 6 plus I could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me.  I don't know if all renewed premium phones are like the one I got but I'm really impressed, better yet I have a full year to put it through it's paces.  I wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank.  My hats off to Amazon and the tech., MM in New Jersey that tested and signed off on the 20 point inspection certificate, nice job on an outstanding phone.",5
89,"(I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 & A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore I  reporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON",2
90,"This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll😍. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its 💯 percent honest.Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.",4
91,"I was impressed with the phone.  The battery lifespan on the phone when I got it says 90%.  Not bad at all!  No scratches, no dents, looked pretty much new.  Saved hundreds and now I have the phone I wanted with 256gb to download anything under the sun which is why I replaced my old phone that only had 18gb.  My work would only allow us to get the 18gb iPhone which really annoyed me but I understood why.  So I took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone & just pay for it myself.  We use AT&T as a provider at my work, so all I needed to do was take out the SIM card from my old iPhone and put it in this 256gb beast....I’m so happy I did.  So far so good.  I recommend this seller for sure. Great product! I will update this review down the line if I end up having any problems out of the ordinary.  Hope this review helps as I was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase.  Also, I purchased using my Amazon credit card which allows you to make 12 monthly payments around $30/month at 0% interest.  I can’t lose!!!  That’s the cost of 10 coffees at Starbucks a month.  I’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs.  Okay, I’m done.  Now I just sound like a bag of hot air.",5
92,"UPDATE:  After I returned the first iPhone, I ordered a second one.  The second one came very quickly as well.  This one came with 81% battery capacity and much less pitting and wear than the 1st one.  Since these are used phones, I guess it really just depends on the luck of the draw.  I did notice the price increased a few dollars when I purchased the second one, so maybe there's something there? Anyways, adjusted my review from 2 to 4 stars.  The second phone deserves 5 stars, but since I had to go through the process of returning the 1st one, which forced me to switch phones 2 weeks later than I would've liked, I say 4 stars is fair.ORIGINAL:To note: I am obviously returning this product, but will give time for the seller to make things right.  I will change/delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation.To the seller's credit, this phone was delivered much faster than expected, almost a week early.  However, what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn't as advertised.  One of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed 80%.  That's directly from the description from the listing.  Imagine my disappointment when I go to settings and see the message ""Your battery's health is significantly degraded..."" ""Maximum Capacity: 76%"".  This is worse than the iPhone 8 I currently have and was trying to ""upgrade"", and keep in mind I had my current iPhone 8 for about 4 years now.  Completely unacceptable.If even after all that, you still decide to purchase one of these, I should also mention, if you look close enough, you can tell you bought a used phone.  This isn't to knock the seller or the product, it's clear you're not getting a new product, just shows minor signs of wear and tear.",4
93,"After only 5 months, the refurbished iPhone 8 has died. Two updates and two restores failed.  $599 down the drain.",1
94,"I purchased this phone for my daughter August 2020 the batter went dead, phone wouldn’t charge no matter what charger we used 01/01/2021. So I took it into Best Buy whom confirmed after running a diagnostic it needed a replacement batter which Was fine. I was willing to pay for the replacement batter BUT after they had open the phone up to put the replacement batter in I was SHOCKED to get a call from them that they could NOT replace the batter due to the battery currently in the phone was SUPER GLUED IN and there were missing components like screws, adhesive around the display and missing cowling. As you can see I have not had this phone for even a year and to be sold something that is just not all there and made to work for a short period of time is insulting! I have paper work and documents of Best Buy’s finding. If I can give it a negative star I would.",1
95,"I ordered the phone as a Christmas present and it arrived looking brand new. However, the sound did not work. She couldn't hear the person on the other end of the phone unless it was on speaker. I requested an exchange instead of refund. Within 2 days, I had the 2nd phone in hand and it was in pristine condition BUT it would not read her SIM card. I took the phone to AT&T thinking it was a SIM card issue. However, it was a device issue. So while in AT&T, I just chose a brand new phone to save myself the hassle of trying to get a working ""renewed"" one through Amazon. I am still waiting for my refund.",1
96,"This was a beautiful phone and a very good price. Everything worked great on it, except, unfortunately, the sound. I could hear everything just fine, but people I called said I sounded like I had my head in a bucket. I ended up returning it, so it might seem strange that I am reviewing it, but just wanted to let buyers know that the 90 day return makes it easy to take a chance on a renewed phone. No questions asked, no tricky stipulations. Just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the 90 days. The next phone I bought seems to be perfect, other than it isn’t that cheerful red. I did subtract one star because I think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale.",4
97,I would give this seller a 0 star in everything if I could. Do not buy from this seller they sell you unpaid iPhones and they are not locked. They can’t be connected because they are not paid off so basically useless.,1
98,"Phone was advertised as unlocked, it was not. We had to visit our carriers store, then call customer service, only to find out there was no way they could help us. Charger that came with phone did not work at all. Phone did have quite a few scratches, and customer support wasn't able to unlock phone or provide much help. If you buy a phone here it will just waste half a day of your life, and you will end up returning it.",1
99,The phone could text and call but could not connect to cellular data. Defective and not as described and now I don’t have a phone for 5-6 days until I can get this replaced.,1
100,"I purchased this phone and after only using it for over 2 weeks it stopped charging.  It just would'nt charge.  after scrambling around the next day trying to find a phone I found a NEW phone I purchased and tried to return this one after forgetting to take the lock off they contacted me and said no refund unless I gave code.  No problem I emailed back and gave them the information, then it was something else, no refund until you do this, then the next email no refund until you do this.  I finally contacted Amazon and they took the purchase off my Amazon store card.  You cant hold peoples refunds hostage because of a defaulted product.  Thank you Amazon for the refund.",1
101,"I bought this phone to replace a cheap Galaxy J3V which ran out of storage space after a few videos (16 gig vs 256 gig).  I saw the Iphone had a different size SIM than the Galaxy so I ordered a new SIM from Verizon at no cost and got it one day after I got the phone.  I charged the Iphone for several hours and started the activation.  Wouldn't activate and I talked to 4 or 5 Verizon people over two days (and long waits for a tech).  The last guy said he could see the phone and the SIM on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone, so I sent it back and said I would try another (the people at KISS were nice and got me a different phone).  Both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed.  Guess what?  Still wouldn't activate.  After over an hour wait on Dec 26, the Verizon tech said I needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal.  This immediately made sense to me (why didn't the other Verizon techs figure this out?)  After a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower, the phone activated in about 15 seconds.  Amazing, right?  Not exactly.  I got back home and couldn't do anything over wifi.  The next morning I got to speak to a tech  right away but no solution.  The next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem.  Guess what, I had to go back to the tower to get a strong LTE signal to activate wifi.  The phone works fine now and I'm very happy with it.  KISS gets good marks and Verizon needs to know some people don't have cell service at their home.",5
102,"I was sold a phone that had A REMAINING BALANCE with tmobile!!! I wasnt even able to activate the phone because they needed to be paid for the phone!! Absolutely furious about it, it was a gift that they cant even use! This seller should be shut down for being so shady!",1
103,very disappointed to see i that its defective. works totally find except that it restarts itself every one or two minutes and the batter says its dead even when its fully charged i guess this happens sometimes so ill try one more time with this seller,1
104,"The phone seemed well at first, all outside conditions were great other than minor scratches. But the phone would sometimes shut down as if dead when could be at high charge. When it would power back on it would say it was completely dead and would only let me be on it for a few minutes before restarting the pattern. Phone wouldn't charge during these moments so there was literally nothing i can do. And sometimes when the phone would do this is would go right back to its normal charge and work as normal until the sequence started back up. This was extremely annoying when i would be busy on my phone. One morning i woke up and the phone would not power on at all, even when tried charging with multiple chargers. I sent it to apple thinking this was a simple battery problem and i could pay a cheap $49 for a replacement but later got a message saying that the phone was completely defected an the problem was far beyond just the need of a battery replacement. Refunding immediately.",1
105,"For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.",4
106,"When I first received this phone it was surprisingly in good shape. The problem started after I put in my SIM card and transferred everything from my previous phone... although I put the SIM card in this new phone it would constantly say “no SIM card” which meant I also didn’t have any service and it did this a couple of times and it annoyed me.... a way that I would resolve it each time is that I would turn the phone off completely and then turn it back on and it worked temporarily until recently when I did it for the last time and it hasn’t showed that for a couple of days now. Another problem that I recently started having with this phone is that I just now noticed that it stopped charging past 80% ... No matter how long it is plugged in for it doesn’t charge higher than 80% anymore and I am so annoyed with this phone... with these troubles that I am having already I might as well just go to apple and get one of theirs , but everything else seems to be working fine but I have a feeling that when it approaches the Amazon return deadline that I’m sure I will encounter more problems.",3
107,As stated. There were no scratches or dings. Looked as if it were new out of the box with 256 GB memory.,5
108,The phone itself looks great and works perfectly! Honestly it was in better shape than I expected.The battery life was really bad. It could only hold a charge for a few hours so I had to have it replaced at the Apple store.Within just a few minutes of me leaving my original feedback  the company that sold it to me (Hybrid IT) called me directly and offered to pay for the battery replacement (which they did).Just simply wow! In less than 10 minutes they called me and made it right.If you want one of these phones I highly recommend you choose the vendor Hybrid IT for it.,5
109,"There are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn't work on Verizon, broke shortly after, etc.  It certainly made me pause before purchasing, but I really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn't going to pay top dollar for a new phone again.I ordered the phone on a Tuesday, and was surprised when the FedEx box showed up on Thursday (a full 4 days earlier than estimated).  Next, the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable.  Finally, the phone looked absolutely brand new.  Not a touch or smudge anywhere.  I immediately took it to the Verizon store, and they got it registered on the network within 5 minutes.I know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine, but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn't work.  It would seem like it's a good company though and perhaps they'd swap it out if you happen to be unlucky (I can imagine it has to occasionally happen - it is a used phone after all, each with a different history).  Apparently I got one from a grandma that didn't take it out of the box. :)Overall, very happy.  Hopefully you will be just as fortunate.  And if not, I'd feel safe about working with them company to make it right.",5
110,"First time buying a refurb phone. Daughter needed a replacement for her old one that looked as if someone had taken a sledge hammer to it. How does a phone get like that? Works great. Delivered with a good battery. It was at or very near 100% life. No dings or scratches. With 256GB of storage I will never hear again about running out of storage. Came with used protective glass installed which had a few chips in the corner but no big deal. Have not got to it yet, but easily replaced. Also bought a silicome cover and replacement glass. 9 months, so far, so good. Could have saved an extra $60 if I had waited until after the Christmas season.",5
111,This product was purchased by my daughter and according to her it was in really good shape to be used/refurbished. I looked at the phone it came with minimal scratches....no cracks. It doesn't come with original apple packaging....but the phone is as promised and good value for price. It does come in a white box with what appears to be a new charger and the little pin to unlock SIM card is underneath the inner packaging. Would purchase from this store again.,4
112,"This is the real thing. Phone works perfectly. It is AT&T locked as described, but not a problem if you have them as your carrier.",5
113,"So happy with the seller and purchase! Shipping was slower than I would’ve liked but first world probs right? The phone was in amazing shape- no damage that I could find at all. I got the iPhone 8 silver and it’s fast, perfect and was such a great deal!",5
114,"I've had this phone for a little over a month now and I love it! I was somewhat scared to buy a refurbished phone, but so far this phone is working wonderfully and arrived in nearly perfect condition. There was a teeny tiny little scratch on the side of the phone, but it is barely noticeable. I only noticed it because I was looking for imperfections when I received the phone. It is much cheaper than buying an apple certified refurbished phone and is probably the exact same quality. Unfortunately, the charger is not an apple product, but is working well so far. If you're looking for a quality new phone that is not ridiculously expensive, I would highly recommend purchasing this one!",5
115,"Purchased two rose gold iPhone 8’s from the company TRADEMORE. The phones arrived in two days and in great condition. Everything seems to work as it should including the cameras, speaker, microphone, and touchscreen. The battery health is above 80% on both phones; which is great for a used/refurbished phone. There is no cosmetic damage to be noted, and all functions worked upon installing my SIM card.TRADEMORE sends the phones in their own packaging and includes a Verizon wall pack with an 8 ft usb to lightning cable. Inside the packaging included a flyer that ensures a 90 day warranty. I’m pleased with the phones and would buy from this company again.",5

117,"I purchased this iPhone 8 (with the Renewed Premium Guarantee) for my daughter.  It arrived in excellent condition.  However, the first day she had it, the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about 40%.  This happened again over the next couple days.  I went into the battery settings (see attached screen shot) and found that the battery was seriously degraded, even though it was supposed to be in ""similar to new"" condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least 90%.  So I called Amazon Customer Support for a replacement phone.  It was a cumbersome process.  The Amazon representative had to contact Apple, and he and I were on hold with Apple for about 20 minutes.  When the Apple representative got on the line, the Amazon rep left the call.  The Apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing.  She then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out-of-warranty pricing to me for a new battery.  I objected, stating that Amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why I had to pay for anything at this point.  She then had to talk with her manager, and again I was on hold for several minutes.  She came back and said that I would have to talk with Amazon about the phone.  So I took the case number she gave and called Amazon back.  I was on hold again for a few minutes with Amazon, but when the customer service rep came on the line, I explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately.  I received the new phone the next day.  It arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly.  Everyone I talked to, both at Amazon and at Apple, was very nice and easy to deal with, it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem.  All told, I was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced.  I am satisfied with the replacement, I just wish the process would have taken less time.",5
118,"I received the phone. Seemed in very good condition. However, it Would not boot up. It stayed on the Apple screen for over an hour. I’m done requested a refund and returned the phone.",1
119,"I almost returned it after I couldn’t get it to read my SIM card. But after multiple attempts, a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and I attempted once more to insert my SIM card into the phone and it slid right in, where as before it must’ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal, and the compartment that holds the SIM card wasn’t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone, but it wasn’t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iPhone, and those were both flush with the phone. I’m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved. I ordered the silver case, its white on the back side not silver, but I still like it. With a case on all u can see is the silver Apple and I guess the white makes it stand out, otherwise it doesn’t seem like it would. The circle around the home button is silver though. This may be what they consider silver🤷🏻‍♀️. Regardless I’m happy with everything, works and looks like a brand new phone. If I have any issues I’ll update.",4

121,"Phone was “renewed” but arrived looking brand new and with 100% battery capacity. Sadly, it has not turned out to be a good buy. Shortly after the return window closed, the phone began having audio and messenger issues. I am now only able to talk in short intervals of 1-5 minutes before the outgoing voice capability drops. I can still hear the person on my phone but they cannot hear me. A quick redial and all is ok again but only for a short time. First few times it happened, I could shutdown phone, power up and the problem would disappear for a few days. Not so any longer. Comes back as quickly as first call after power up. Haven’t been able to discern a pattern for length of call. Seems to randomly go out. Sometimes it will last 5 minutes, sometimes 45 seconds. iMessage also randomly converts to SMS. Quick restart seems to correct that issue but phone doesn’t seem to recover iMessage function without restart once it drops. Everything else seems to (at least right now) work as it should. Tired of dealing with it so I am back in the market for a new iPhone.",2
122,I read a lot of reviews prior to ordering.. since I didnt want to get ripped off! I ordered this phone  expecting to possibly having to send it back. It came almost 5 days  earlier then Amazon saying. All the buttons work great. No scratches. The first day I thought the battery was weak- but battery life status told me it was a 100%.I must have not had it fully charged... havent noticed any issues at all!Very happy about my purchase! Will try to write another review down the road seeing how its holding up.,5
123,Purchased iphone and was told phone was stolen and can not be turned on based on 15 digit code that comes with iphone.  Am returning product today.,1
124,When I ordered this phone I had all kinds of apprehension over it being what they promised. I have never spent that amount on money on a phone and it scared me. This phone is in perfect condition without any blemishes at all!!! The phone charges quickly and holds a charge really well. I love my new phone.,5
125,"came in a plain box with a non-Apple charger block with a new Apple lightning cord for charging. Phone is in excellent condition, no scratches anywhere, easy to set up, Ryan is nice and loud and screen snd pictures and video taken performance according to expectation",5
126,works as expected,5
127,"Bought two iPhones from these guys. I'm barely past the warranty period and one of the iPhones consistently shuts off when it gets a little warm. We only noticed recently because the person I gifted the phone to didn't start using it until one month ago. It took a month to really notice the problem. I called and explained the situation to these guys, and they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough. Since we were out of warranty, they just said ""nope, no exceptions."" I understand that technically they don't have to work with us to solve the problem, but seriously, in this day and age, great companies who care about customer service will be reasonable and help find a solution. I'm even willing to pay a little for them to swap out phones, but they were completely dismissive and rude to me on the phone and 100% unwilling to help. I'd recommend taking your chances buying a phone with another company. If you ever run into any problem, these guys clearly have zero interest in doing the right thing. Very disappointing.",1
128,"Ordered the gold tone (it's more like rose gold but that is what I expected/wanted) Iphone 8 on Thursday afternoon and was notified just a few hours later that it had shipped.  It arrived on Monday (regular mail).  It looks BRAND NEW, not a scratch on it anywhere.  Took it to local carrier to switch service from previous phone to them and everything has worked perfectly since then.There's been a bit of fun learning curve as this phone is much more advanced than my previous (slider) but I figured it was time to get closer to the age of 2021 technology.  No owners booklet came with it but any info needed can easily be googled.I could have purchased this same phone from a cell phone repair shop in town but this one was $80 cheaper and with the generous 90 day return policy, there was no doubt in my mind that this phone was the one to go with.I am quite pleased with it!BTW--KEEP THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING ETC, JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE PHONE.  YOU HAVE A 90 DAY RETURN WINDOW IN CASE SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE PHONE.",5
129,"The iphone 8 came in a great case. At first i was impressed. After switching over my data, I discovered 2 major flaws with the phone.1) Camera hardware malfunction.  Not fixable.2) Battery life was about 3 hours on a FULL charge.I decided to return it only to find out i had to pay the shipping. All in, waste of time and $10.00 loss in shipping back to the seller.",1
130,"The product description says compatible with all network carriers (including Sprint) but after receiving the phone and attempting to activate it, I was told by 2 separate Sprint reps that the IMEI number will not work on their network. When contacting the seller they acknowledged this and only offered to provide a return label. I asked for a exchange for the same phone this time one that works with CDMA (not GSM) and my request was ignored. Why does the seller advertise ""All network carriers: untruthfully? It's a waste to time to buy from here is the need is CDMA. (Sprint and Verizon)",1
131,"Dislikes:1. Because this was a refurbished unit, the battery life is not that of a new phone.2. The Wi-Fi hotspot loses connectivity - at times it is better to is the Bluetooth connection, which eats more data.3. I came from android, so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing. This makes the ""Home Screen"", which is the only place you can put widgets, useless. I want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone. Apple offers very limited widgets. Most apps do not have one.4. There is a glitch in the iPhone 8 that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times.Likes:1. Not requiring anti-virus is nice.2. Siri is worlds better than Google Assist. (waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options, like ""Siri, read me the content of website xyz"", etc.). Siri is the main reason I switched from android. It is awesome!!!",5
132,I'm returning this phone because the battery health is significantly degraded. Under Amazon renewed policy this phone should have not been shipped. All phones are to be tested for battery health and guaranteed to have a minimum battery capacity of 80%.,1
133,"Amigo o amiga si usted fue como yo interesado en comprar un iphone renewed este es su review, lo primero es que notas que hay demasiados review negativos, algunos tienen buenas bases y otro son una locura como molestarse porque el iphone llego con alguna raya tiene que entender que son iphone de segunda mano, si ya entendio eso puede seguir leyendo, el truco aca es comprarle a un vendedor confiable muchos compradores en amazon no saben que puedes escoger el vendedor en la lista cuando revisa un articulo, yo por lo menos le compre a TI Hibryd 99% de reputacion, las fotos hablan por si solas, equipo en excelente condiciones, completamente desbloqueado, veo que muchos compradores adquieren iphone con vendedores poco fiables con 60 a 80% de calificaciones positivas y pasan malos momentos, si TI hybrid me costo 12$ mas pero es mejor pagar esa diferente que arriesgarte con otro vendedores, porque si sale dañado es dificil una devolucion desde LATAM es demasiada cara.. El iphone vino con cable y cargador genericos nuevos, no son originales pero parecen de buena calidad, el unico detalle fue que la bateria llego con 87% algo baja pero aun por arriba de la descripcion que indica que va a ser superior a 80% ... el truco aca es comprarle el iphone a un vendedor con al menos 95%, doy 4 estrellas por el uso de la bateria por el precio creo que debio ser igual o por arriba del 90%... actualizare mi review en unos cuantos meses para saber si el equipo funciono sin problema",4
134,"I received the iPhone 8 with a new/free screen protector installed. This was nice but unexpected. Upon closer examination I saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so I removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches. The lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches. Ultimately, I did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent.  I am in the process of returning the iPhone 8 and will find another vendor.",2
135,"My iPhone was scheduled to be delivered the day after the long Labor Day weekend, but it actually arrived the Friday before, which was an unexpected surprise. There were no scratches at all on the body or screen of the phone, it looked to be in virtually perfect cosmetic shape. Once I got it running from my iCloud backup everything seemed to work exactly as expected, and now a week later still is functioning perfectly.  The camera takes excellent photos, the screen is slightly better than my iPhone 7 it replaced, and wireless charging seems to work perfectly- no excess heat, not overly slow. My only possible complaint with the phone is that it came in with a slightly lower battery health percentage than I was hoping for- 89%. I was hoping I'd get something in the low to mid 90's still for battery health, but I get a full day with moderate to heavy use so can't really complain about that.  All in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the phone or BuySpry",4
136,This is a STOLEN PHONE!!!!,1
137,"Everything was fine until the screen started glitching not even a month in. Now the bottom of the screen mirrors the top. Depending on how high or low I set my brightness, it’s either really distracting or not very noticeable. Everything else works fine and the glitch doesn’t show in screenshots or screen recordings.",3
138,"I upgraded from an Iphone 6s to an Iphone 8. I had been looking around and saw this refurbished one on Amazon for $248 and decided to take a chance on it. I also had $40 of credits to use. I figured it's backed by Amazon with their 90 day warranty too. I don't play games or watch movies or any of those things so I didn't need to get the newest Iphone that's out there. My old one had 16GB this one has 64, so I'm getting 3 times what I had. I like the smaller size too which is another reason why I got the 8. They do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger.  The charger lasted 4 days and broke, good thing my old charger works on it. I've only had it for a week but so far, so good. I will update my review after I've had the phone longer.",4
139,"The phone arrived in great condition. No visible scratches and everything seems to work. Very pleased with the fit and finish. The battery health reads 79% after a few days of use, when I thought to check it. Entirely possible the vendor shipped it with 80% remaining.I am replacing an Xr, and I have to say I forgot how limited my last iPhone 8’s battery capacity was when it gave up the ghost. If you are replacing an iPhone 8 this may not be a big deal, but I’m going to have to charge multiple times a day if I talk for any amount of time. Just keep charges around your home, office, and vehicles and this shouldn’t be a problem. I feel that was the one trade off I made with a refreshed unit-battery life.",4
140,"Literally ordered this on 12/8/20, received by 12/10. Beautiful phone, no scratches and just 2 small light spots on the screen. My daughter was able to plug it up and we took it to the be official registred with our phone carrier. Phone didn't hold a charge long, but we thought this was due to the phone needing to be charged (just arrived that day).  BY THE NEXT DAY we realized that the phone would not stay on without being on the charger. Tried another iphone charger (not the one that came with the phone), phone stayed on while off the charger, until you pressed the screen - INSTANTLY CUT OFF.  Took it to the Apple store for what I thought might be a battery replacement, but after diagnostics the problem is the device won't power on the LOGIC BOARD (BRAIN), so the device simply won't power on correctly. Recommends new phone...WTF!Now I have to send this back for a refund...there is no way that this company couldn't have known this if Apple picked up on it in 20 minutes.",1
141,"I purchased this refurbished phone 3/7/2020 for $229.96.  Prior to purchasing the phone, I  asked about the battery life.  Now, the battery is dead as of 8/5/2020, less than 5 months after purchase.  Usage cost me $45.99/month average based on purchase price.  I could have had a current brand new  IPhone for that monthly usage cost.  Do not use this vendor.  They should have replaced the battery as a good will gesture even if past warranty date.  As a business owner, that is how I would have taken care of a customer to earn future business from them.  Shame on ELECTRONIC DEALS.Reply from  vendor:Hi Brigitte, we are very sorry to hear this. Unfortunately, the order is past 90 days old and the warranty period has expired. We suggest taking the device in to Apple or a local authorized Apple technician for repair.We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused.Kind Regards,ELECTRONIC DEALS FAMILY & STAFF",1
142,Bought it for my wife and she is pissed. This phone is not unlocked as it says in the description. Took it to the apple store and they were unable to do anything with it. They said it is probably a stolen phone that still has a balance with Tmobile. Will be returning for a refund.,1
143,"Motherboard Failure suddenly stops working, feel ripped offI payed 300.00 dollars for 12 month.This is the first iPhone I purchased however online with Amazon I personally will not purchase any more Apple products with Amazon online what A distasteful experience. Amazon has lost my trust in providing reputable sellers online.Pay more and know what you will receive will last for years not month.I will be reporting Amazon and this seller to the Better Business Bureau",1
144,"I bought a used iphone 8 and it was amazon certified. I opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. I have had it about a month now and I havent had any issues at all with the phone's performance. Battery lasts a long time, no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi/no wifi.I was so leery about getting a used phone. I've always gone new. When I saw it was only $200, it's worth a shot vs spending $800 on a new phone again. They gave me a 90 day return policy as well for the piece of mind. So far, this was the best bang-for-buck deal rather than buying a new phone. As long as I dont have any issues in the near future, I will continue to buy used phones from Amazon that are certified.",5
145,"The good:1. The phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before Christmas.2. It looked perfect, no physical defects.The bad & the ugly:1. I discovered the phone came from Japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off, by law. Took it to the Apple Store, and said they couldn't do anything about it. I take a lot of photos, and the loud click is a pain. But, that was a minor detail for the price.2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again... Or else, monthly payments on a NEW phone may no longer look as optional... :(",3
146,"Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.",2
147,"The phone arrived early but couldn't be set up for a while b/c of the pandemic.  Then it was either locked or had some other problem and took Two phone calls, 2 technicians and a supervisor to be able to figure out what to do.  Imagine that, I sat in T-Mobile for almost an hour thinking I would have to return this one (which I should have because the battery life is not even a day.  The phone gets hot faster than I had expected or previously experienced.  The volume is maybe 70 percent of what it should be.  Live and learn, but I really can't be without a phone and I sure wouldn't use this company due to the problems (I still don't know why there were so many issues with setting it up at T-Mobile) and it is used for remote working, telehealth, etc.  I'm pretty much stuck with a phone that I doubt lasts a year; the battery could die any day now.",1
148,"I thank the seller because I was skeptical about the purchase and debated for a bit before taking the leap and purchasing. I am so glad that I did. I can understand why the seller is listed as the Best and are ranked as #1. Just like others who purchased this phone, I expected it to have issues and not be worth the purchase. However, I received the phone 5 days earlier than noted. It also arrived literally looking brand new and it works as if I had just purchased a brand new Iphone. Let's just say I am overly excited that I got such a deal and an amazing purchase. I am ready to buy all kinds of cases and accessories for my new phone! Yay!",5
149,"It was such a nice relief to receive a renewed phone that looked new, packaged as a new device with vinyl covering on front and back and everything to get my son going.  The customer support was phenomenal!  To be fair, I ran into a small issue with the battery. Battery health was 79% after opening it and using it for 2 weeks...did we check that status before...no.  The seller says it should always be above 80% and will gladly refund, return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if I visit an authorized Apple store.  I chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery.  Seller not only reimbursed the total amount, it was actually more that the receipt I sent, maybe for my time and effort?  In any case, totally happy with the purchase, completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller.  Phone looked perfect and still acts 100%, like-new, 3 months later.",5

I was going to return it, but since I didn't realize it was not fully unlocked for a couple weeks (after my phone company had sent me SIM cards a few times and we could not figure out why it would not work, all while living at the NICU with our baby), I will not get but half of my money back if I return it.

They finally agreed that they would email the vendor - that was the extent of their HELP and Backing. Caution on ordering items listed as Amazon Backed- doesn't mean much. Not sure why they say ""Product works and looks like new. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee."" if they don't really mean it.#Frustrated",1

158,"The iPhone I got wouldn't ring when people called me. Adjusting settings and resetting the phone didn't fix it. So, I asked for an exchange rather than a refund because other than the ringing issue, I was happy with the phone. They told me the phone was on the way, so I wanted to wait until it was about to arrive to send the faulty one back because my job requires two-factor authentication to log into my companies' network. I can't work without it. When the last day arrived, I mailed the phone back, but they already canceled my replacement because I didn't send the phone back right away, and they assumed I was trying to scam them. They should have told me they weren't going to send my replacement until they got the other one back. That's not what they led me to believe. I contacted them and asked when I would get my phone and they said that all they can do is wait until they get the phone to refund me. So, now I don't have my phone that I need for work and lots of other things. When I do get my refund, I'm not giving my money back to these people.",1
159,"This phone was terrible. Returned it and waiting for refund. The phone was glitching, calling people keyboard would just type randomly letters by the hundreds. Couldn’t open apps yet apps would open on their own. Very upset.",1
160,"Even tho i had to return i must give high marks to seller.  Kiss electronics for a incredibly nice refurbished phone. Think it was just a problem i was having on my end. Read up on it a bit kinda of a common problem but others seemed to fix with updates. My issue was only getting 1 bar and dropping calls, everywhere i went. I live in Houston TX. Not lacking cell tower power.  At&t account for well over 20+ years. Ive seen a few phones. Tryed updates but couldn't get them to finish. Tryed at&t my account is probably older then the kids in there and they seemed to have the mindset that it wasnt there phone so not there problem unless i was ready to drop alot of cash. So no problem at all with seller or amazon on this. On home wifi it was perfectly fine phone if i could have gotten some reasonable help from At&t probably would have gotten it sorted out",4
161,"I like this, but I think I should have gone with the 8 plus, this thing is tiny in my hand.  One thing I'm not a fan of is that Apple seems to have taken away the ability to make my own custom ringtones for the thing.  It's one of two things that makes me keep thinking of going to android, but I have bought so much music, TV shows, and movies on iTunes, that the idea of doing it is a bit daunting.",4
162,"I am so impressed with these phones we ordered! They really are like new. Ours came without ANY physical blemishes. The battery health for each is 89% and 90% which is so much better than I was expecting. They included the necessary charging items and a sim card removal tool. I was able to switch out both sim cards for both phones myself and never had to make a trip into our phone provider. Easy peasy! We are both pleased with this purchase and would definitely order from this place again. Also, the phones came a day early!",5
163,"I was skeptical at first about buying another used phone as me previous used phone was decent but. Was a little rough around the edges. When I decide it was time for an upgrade I knew I wasn’t gonna be going for the newest iPhone because I wanted something cost effective and I don’t really care about having the newest one when they come out. Being this was a different sell I figured I would give it a shot. And the only complaint I have was the color wasn’t what I was expecting it almost looks like rose gold. Like pink essentially. But I’ve grown to like it. And it would disconnect from my phone carrier sometimes and say no service. But it hasn’t done that in a while so I’m extremely happy to say I think for the condition, GB size and battery life. This was a good purchase. The phone performs very well in various aspects. Camera takes good pictures, visual quality of the screen is great for watching videos or playing games, and the battery life can last an entire 9 hour shift at work with battery to spare. Of course that make be using it sparingly but I believe 4-8 hours is about how long you could use it continuously. Depending on the app and things like that. Once again great purchase 🤙🏾",5
164,"UPDATE Feb. 2021  -- one year later -- the charging function of the charger cord stopped working now.. made a grave error buying this phone from whoever used amazon to sell their messed-up item. no good, no good!The ""generic' charger / data carrier cable they added to it was not good for transferring files or photos from phone to laptop. It did not work at all. It did do the charging part of its job though -- but only when attached to the electrical outlet in the wall but definitely not when i needed to charge the phone via laptop",2
165,"I was looking for an older model iPhone with a good amount of life left in it. Since the 8 isn’t sold new anywhere, this refurbished option seemed worth a try. Upon arrival the phone was unlocked and in great shape with only a few minor scrapes on the outside edge; battery life was at 88% of original. The only small problem I was having was that the response to touch on the screen was intermittent, something with which I could probably manage.I decided to ask the seller about a replacement; once I started the return process (with a request for a replacement) the seller communicated very quickly and had a label for me to mail the old phone back that same day.The replacement came in as quickly as the old went out. It had a more responsive touch screen and even better battery life. So far no other problems.I am very happy with the used / renewed phone and even happier that the seller was so easy to work with. Thanks!Seller was PDI Mobile.",5
166,"Purchased the iPhone 8 64g1. It arrived on time2. It was packaged well3. The overall appearance of the phone was beyond good. I believe we could only find one very small scratch on the case when held a certain way in the light.4. No problems at all setting up.5. Seriously, it's like new!We got this for my daughter to replace her iPhone 6s that only had 16g phone storage. This phone is perfect for her. She's a teen that uses all the social apps and the 64g handle them all plus pics and vids.We went with this seller because of all the good reviews, the offer of a 90-day warranty. I feel that I made the best choice for a refurbished phone. In a couple. We will purchase from this seller again.",5
167,"So, many negative reviews describe issues with phone, scratches, battery life, etc.I took a risk as the price was decent for a newer mode 64 GB phone to upgrade my older 16 GB one.Yes, mine came with a battery life of 87, but that was WAY better than my old iphone.Came in a simple box with off brand but working charging block and wire, with SIM card push pin.At the moment (about a week), I can say the phone looks and works AMAZING.Looks brand new, works smooth, updated to iOS 14 with no issues.The negative reviews here seem legit, but my experience was great, and for the price of <$300, felt it was worth the risk and Amazon has a good return policy.I am SUPER happy with purchase, and encourage people to weigh the risks, and order with plan to return if it isn’t ideal, but know that I LOVE my new phone.",5
168,"Looked like brand new.  Manual not in box but since it is a refurbished, I didn't expect it and it's easy enough to download on the net.  Works like brand new.  The only thing I didn't realize was Apple changed the shade of gold.  Not too happy with Apple but very happy with the product over all.  A nice black case solved the new apple gold problem.  The best thing?  the price.",5
169,"I purchased this renewed iphone  8 in December 2020 for my wife to replace a very old previous one. It’s operation has been far less than consistent owing to increasing occurrence of dropped calls, inability to reach attempted calls, and generally declining performance. I purchased this phone on the basis of having a great experience with buying a renewed iPhone 8 Plus from Amazon.Anyway, we’ve had this phone since December 2020 knowing it is technically past a warranty/return, but nevertheless, given my very long and strong status as an Amazon customer, I’m hopeful some form of remedy may be possible for this failing phone.",2
170,"The phone feels very study. The battery life if great. I got the phone yesterday and have been trying to set it up. I attempted to create an apple acct, but it stated too many people  have created an acct with this phone. Unable to create an account. I also tried to download a free game in the apple store and it said I  had to pay for it, which tells me this phone is not completely unlock. If I continue to have road blocks, I will have to return this phone, even though I really like it. FYI Face recognition got a one, because I am unable to create an acct.",5
171,It came a couple of days before it was expected to which was great. Opened the box and it was just the phone and a charger like advertised. I’m very surprised at the look of it. The phone looks like it’s brand new. It works very great. It is unlocked and was easy just to pop in my sim from my iPhone 6s into this iPhone 8. I upgraded from the 6s to the 8 because I have had the 6s for 5 years now and never gotten it cracked or broken or anything and it works fine but in the last couple of weeks to a month now it seems like the 6s battery isn’t lasting as long after a charge so instead of finding a place to try to get it replace for god knows how much I figured it was time to upgrade my phone and now I’m glad I did.,5
172,"Bought this renewal product as a gift. It came in 2 days (Nov 16 to Nov 18) but item is not as the description. It was advertised as battery exceed 80% (This product will have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new) but it was exactly at 80% which means I have to replace a new battery eventually which costs another $80-$100. The screen freezes off a lot of time and one one point, only the home button works. I have to do hard reset to make it coming back to usual. Trying to call customer services but no one available, emailing them is no help. I regret to buy this. Now I have to take time to return plus I need to find a different one in 2 days. Horrible experience",1
173,I picked up the phone to replace my wife’s iPhone 6. Prior to buying an iPhone 8 through this method I read through a bunch of reviews. I admit that I was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device. I took the chance and bought it. The device was in really good shape. These phones are all glass. There wasn’t a scratch on the thing. It is pristine. My own 8plus has been in cases the entire time I’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the 8 I purchased here. There are zero signs of wear on the lightning port . Battery was at 90% health. I updated it to iOS 13 (it had 12) The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new.  I can safely recommend this product and seller.,5
174,"The phone was beautiful and perfect in great condition! However, the shutter sound would not mute, which meant it was probably from Japan where it is illegal to mute the camera shutter sound. You can't even turn it down. There was NOTHING I could do to mute the sound. I tried everything, even running it on another app. I returned the phone...I was sad because it was perfect. If you don't mind the sound, you should but it...be beware!",2
175,"At first I thought I got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box, which sounds fine at first, but the box had the details of a completely different phone so I was sweating a bit when I saw that. The phone was correct, though, and came in good condition. It wasn't perfect, as you'd expect from a refurbished phone; there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner, but that doesn't bother me one bit since it's covered by my case. I think that $280 is a good price for a well-refurbished iPhone 8, since it also comes with the trust that it's in top renewed condition versus buying for less from FB marketplace or something like that. I also purchased the protection plan which covers drops, cracks, water damage, etc. and it is well worth it to me. After the initial $50 payment, paying $29 to have my phone repaired or $49 to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me.",5
176,I don’t even know where to start! I didn’t even wanna give this one star! I Bought this as a gift for my niece for her birthday once she got it activated all it did was mess up didn’t want to stay charged! No one could even hear her talking to us she couldn’t hear anything her volume didn’t wanna work everything about this phone is broken I’m still trying to figure out how to get my money back and a response from the seller!! I took the phone to the nearest phone store and they told us it was a defective phone and that’s why were having the issues were having...,1
177,"This phone did not work with my carrier even though I was assured it would.  I never hooked it up because it was not compatible with t mobile/sprint.  I sent it back exactly how it was sent to me, all the accessories, in absolutely perfect condition and they charged me a $40 restocking fee!!!! I have been communicating back and forth where they finally said a supervisor would call me but never did. I would definitely not recommend this seller it was a terrible experience",1
178,The seller got the phone here very quickly. It was packed as indicated and included charger that seems to work well. The phone aesthetically looks great. Scratch free as far as I can tell. No trouble operating. Needed updating to the latest iOS. The only disappointing part is the Battery Condition. These Renewed phones are guaranteed to come with batteries that have at least 80% capacity left. Mine came in at 81%. So technically its acceptable but unfortunately I will be spending another $50 soon for a new battery because it does not last under a day of light/moderate use. SO don't think you are getting a nice iPhone 8 at $177. It will cost you more like $230 when all is said and done.,5
179,"Even though I purchased a renewed phone, I can't tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality.  I didn't rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because I haven't (and probably won't) use those features.  The battery life is sufficient for my activities, so it gets a 5-star rating.  I don't play games or watch videos on it so far (since I'm an old geezer, lol!), but I do have a few, favorite apps I access from time to time.  If you're not really tech savvy (like me) and can't figure out how to close the apps, just google the question and you'll find the answer.  Closing the apps saves the battery, naturally.  (I read where some were complaining about the battery life and, if they're not closing the apps, this may be the culprit.)I had an old Android before and would never go back since purchasing an iPhone.  I've read the iPhone is much more intuitive to use.  Now, I have demonstrated such to myself.The camera is quite an improvement over the one in my Android.  (The Android couldn't flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing.)  I've taken some really beautiful, true-to-color (imo) photos with the iPhone 8--comparable to my expensive (for me) Canon Rebel AND I don't have to change lenses for closeups, lol!  Phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically, too.  I'm still learning all the features of the phone (not just the camera) and will get more proficient over time.I really, really, love my ""new"" phone and wouldn't hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again.  This is the first time I've purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used/renewed phone, especially over the internet.  I had absolutely no problem activating it (cell provider even gave me a free SIM card) and no malfunctions for the two weeks (now) that I've been using the phone.  The only thing I would recommend to some reviewers/buyers (who say their phone won't charge) is the plug will fit into the phone either way.  I found out it will only charge one way, however.  So, I marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since.  (The plug in my old phone would only fit one way, so I couldn't screw up, lol!)  Also, there's a way to put the battery indicator (life percent and charging indicator) on the front of your phone (at the upper right corner).  Just google how to do this, too.  Easy-peazy!  That way, you always know if the phone is charging (by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol) and the percentage of charge.  (I think my old Android had this feature on the front as a default.  I had to direct the iPhone to do this.  That's not a complaint.  There may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this, either, if they want it on their front screen.)",5
180,"I just received the phone, it seems to be in working order but since it is a gift it will not get set up until after Christmas, I want it noted that it is not like new, it has scratches at the upper right corner, they do not look horrible but they are noticeable and also the speaker on the top is dirty and crusty looking, it had a screen protector on it but it was not sealed on, it was taped on. I'm going to give it as the gift, but if the recipient has an issue with any of this I will be returning it.",1
181,"I've been an iPhone user for the past 13 years, and while I love the interface and design, I do not like paying the high price for a new phone. Last month, after dropping my iPhone 6 (I know I'm very behind on the models, but it still worked well!), I made the decision to upgrade. I love that I can use Amazon Renewed to find a iPhone at a fraction of the price of a new one.Many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems. Since the seller Hybrid IT had great reviews, I felt better about taking the risk. (To be noted, I initially bought a iPhone 6S from Hybrid IT, but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iPhone 8. The return was easy and the seller was helpful!)The phone I received was in great condition, and I had no trouble setting it up with my AT&T SIM card. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and I haven't run into any issues.There are a few things to add, the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug-in. It did not come with headphones, so if you are buying an iPhone 8, you'll have to buy Bluetooth headphones or Earpods with the lightning connector, which are about $29 on the Apple site. Finally, the battery health is at 84% according to my phone, which is expected with a refurbished phone. It does last me through the day, but something to note if you are in the market. I hope this helps!",5
182,"A nice IPhone with really good features and affordable. The only problem it’s some scratches on the phone and the battery health because it’s not a brand new phone, in my case I don’t have a lot of scratches but I have 84% of battery health. The seller that provide me with gifts, a case and a ceramic screen protector.I love this IPhone, it’s similar at the one I had before and have more storage than before for a lot less money. If you want a great iPhone or you are new to this, you can buy an iPhone SE 2020.But if you know what’s best for you, I highly recommend this one",5
183,Exactly what I was hoping for. Great condition barely any scratches! Screen protector and case were included!!! What else could you ask for. I’d buy from this seller again.,5
184,The phone is almost new and I didn't find any obvious defects. But The charger and USB cable are not original. They are good in quality but the seller didn't say. No headphone connector. The price decreased from 579.87 to 559.99 before I receive the package. Disappointed somehow.,2
185,"Overall, this phone is great, just as advertised! I use StraightTalk and this phone was easy to switch over. One thing I absolutely HATE and is causing me to return the phone is the shutter sound on the camera. Everything else was as expected, but as in other reviews I see this phone might have originated from a place where the shutter sound is mandatory (see other similar reviews). I am super not a fan of this! It happens on places where the camera is used as well, like Snapchat. Made it really weird when I was taking pictures of my notes in the library. I've tried everything to get it to turn off, but I will be returning this phone and purchasing it directly through my carrier (which is what I was trying to avoid by making this purchase). Would've been PERFECT except this one feature.",3
186,Out of the box I only noticed some small scratches on the screen that weren't noticeable when the phone was off. As I continued to use the phone I realized the left speakers were not functional at all and it would stop charging when it was plugged in. The battery life on mine was also pretty dismal.The return process is deliberately slow and difficult. I cannot recommend buying from this seller.,2
187,"Pretty much like new. I was quite skeptical given its Amazon and one step removed from the Wild West but the device is just about like new. A strong battery, no scratches, everything functions well and it even came with a tempered glass screen protector. I’m very impressed with the Renewed program.",5
188,"I used to be an apple fanatic and then I switched to Google Pixel. Recently had a bad experience with a refurbished Google Pixel 2 phone because I failed to read the buyers reviews (always read them folks especially when buying refurbished phones) and I decided to go back to Apple because, why not.I didn't want any of the latest models because honestly I don't care for them so I was looking for an iPhone 8 in good quality and with significant storage. I came across this one and I was able to find a 64GB gold iPhone 8 through Verizon pre-owned. Honestly, highly recommend buying from Verizon pre-owned because not only did it accept my Cricket Wireless SD card effortlessly BUT, the phone is literally intact. It basically looks brand new. No scratches, not even on the corners. Clean screen and back of the phone. The fingerprinting works perfectly. All of its features work as if it was a brand new phone! Plus battery life so far has been doing incredibly well. So if you're thinking about switching over but are skeptical, try looking at Verizon pre-owned and their reviews and purchase!Looking forward to continuing taking bomb selfies with this phone.",5
189,"Pros: Everything looked great (much better than expected like new, 83% battery health). little to no scratches on screen even looking at it close up.Cons: I went to make a call and the earpiece isn't audible on max volume so I have to return/exchange. I wasted a few hours setting up the phone and return process isn't the super smooth qr code drop off .You must hunt down a printer (who has one of those these days!) and affix the label yourself.Maybe avoid unless you have a gambler's personality like me with too much time on your hands? There is a non-zero chance the exchange I get will also have a problem if they aren't even checking if you can make a call and hear the person on the other end. Everyone is different and if you get a great deal go for it, just realize you might have to return it for something more than just regular wear but a functional issue.",2
190,I’ve bem using it for 2 weeks and it looks perfect. The battery will have 90% of the capacity but I strongly recomend in buying this. I iniciatially bought this to sell the phone in a trade-in but I liked it and now I am going to stay with it. I am from brazil and it is working with no problem at all,5
191,"The product feels brand new. Sometimes I forget that I purchased a refurbished phone. The only thing I do wish they included is a pair of headphones. Other than that I am completely satisfied with this purchase. Battery life is great, and the phone has not slows down at all. If your coming from an Iphone SE or 6s I would say this is your best bang for your buck.",5
192,"When I bought this used/refurbished phone, I was just happy to get an ""upgrade"" from my ancient IPhone 6; what I needed was something secondhand, affordable and still usable.I was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new—even pristine, as promised by seller.In terms of functionality, the sensors and controls feel as though I've bought a new phone. All 256gb was available. The speakers, microphone and display work very well.When I was switching out the sim card from my old IPhone 6, the IPhone 8 started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer, without my activating the migration function - very cool. The transfer was so near perfect that the IPhone 8 migrated all my WhatsApp messages, which I was expecting to lose (because I don't use icloud). The migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms, I needed to type in the initial passwords again (even though they were transferred to and saved on the IPhone 8) - just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time.By the way, I am a Singapore buyer, and this order was routed through an Oregon transshipment facility, before it was shipped to Singapore.What's the takeaway I can offer in this review? Buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw: there is a chance you may get a dud. In this order, I am happy to say that I got exactly what the seller promised. So here's my 5-star thumbs up!",5
193,"I purchased this phone and my carrier, Cricket blocked my use of data and messages unless on wifi. When we called to figure out why, they had stated that the phone was blacklisted by AT&T in January of 2019. Meaning, this phone was not meant to be sold to anyone. Very disappointed.",1
194,"Alright so I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review on our phone (in case we came across any problems with it). Fortunately, we’ve had our IPhone 8 since December now it’s January and have had zero problems with it. The phone actually came in pristine condition, no scratches or blown out/distorted speaker or any other problems! I do see that there’s others here that, sadly, have problems with their phone from the minute they receive it and I think it has a lot to do with the seller. Before I purchased our phone I checked the different sellers and ratings/reviews and ultimately we went with Hybrid IT. Take a look for yourselves, I strongly recommend this seller for anyone looking to get one of these phones!",5
195,"The phone I have now works so well, it's in seemingly perfect condition! For what I paid for a used phone, I feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day. I wish I could give four stars. There were several communication issues/ product issues that I felt took this order in a wonky direction. 1.) The order was sent to my address with signature required. When I asked to remove the required signature (I'm not home all the time), the package was sent the next day to a location one state away. Rather than spend another four to five days without a phone, I chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the FedEx facility. Okay.2.) The first phone stopped working after a few weeks. Believe me, being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue (I don't even have a phone at home, what if I had to call 911? My employer? Etc.) They gave me a VERY quick and flexible response, saying they would replace or return the phone. Amazing response! They told me to remove my iCloud info and delete the email app, which was impossible because it wouldn't even turn on, but no problem, they removed the iCloud account and email when I turned it in somehow. However, they did not mention that I would have to hold onto the SIM card!So they sent me a new iPhone, nice model, everything fine, except- no SIM card. 3.) No SIM card. By this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis, my carrier was closed except for in one location (fine) but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service (not fine - no phone.) After all the drama I figured out how to call them without activation on my own. A few days later I got the SIM. Anyway, the NEW phone works outstandingly, the exchange was smooth, they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees. However the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery, the first phone battery stopping completely, and the lack of communication about holding my old SIM card backed up my phone use. I'm all set now though. Four stars.",4
196,"I bought the Renewed Premium to get a better Iphone 8 and that was money well spent. The battery life was important as I had a previous Iphone 6S and the battery was horrible. This time the battery was at 91% and the initial charge went from 100% to 50% in 5 days, thought I admit I don't use the phone often. The fact that I did not use the phone often did not stop the previous phones from losing the charge within 24 hours. The phone operates very nicely and has all the options I need. The phone is in excellent condition also. I certainly recommend!",5
197,This should be against the law. To sell a fake iphone for $400 and not make it well known that it is a FAKE IPHONE is disgusting! The phones volume would cut out at random and when I try to restart it it would take hours. After a few weeks it would not read my SIM card so I took it to my carrier phone store and they told me that it was not a real! SHAMEFUL!!!,1
198,"Shipping was fast but the phone was scratched, sometimes it wont shift between camera settings, and there was NO SIM card! I was very frustrated.I lost my iPhone 11 so the iPhone 8  is my back up. The camera quality feels so poor compared to what I’m used to but that has nothing to do with the seller.I just really wish I would’ve been more aware that the seller did not include a SIM card with purchase of the phone.I live six hours round-trip from a Verizon store so they had to ship me the SIM card before I could even activate the phone. That took another 5 days.",3
199,Bought this in April. By November it stopped working and the company will not replace or refund.  The phone touch screen was wonky. Sometimes would work. Sometimes would not.The battery never made it through a full day.In nov some water splashed on it- not submerged and the phone died.  This seller claims it is water resistant up to 3 meters.  Very dissappointed.,1
200,"I phone 8 is in good condition and works as it should. Only came with the phone itself and charge cord. No plug for cord was included. Shipping took longer than expected. Was to be delivered 11/28 and arrived December 5, 2019. minimal directions on activating the phone.",4
201,"I am a 12 year old girl, and I payed my own money for this phone. It came in the mail on the last day that it said it would, so kind of on time. The only cosmetic problem is that the outer ring of the camera is a bit scratched, but you can hardly see it. The touch screen works perfectly. The fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty, but that is the only time. I put in my left thumb, right thumb, left pointer, and right pointer into the thing and all of them work 99% of the time. The battery life is good, but I leave it on dark mode, True Tone off, and I always like to keep the brightness down. The phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings, and so if you’re in a dark room, it goes dark and vice versa. Overall the phone is great, and I definitely recommend it, especially for the price. I hope that this review is helpful.",5
202,"The overall physical condition of my “refurbished” iPhone 8 is excellent!  I can’t find a scratch on the device.  The transfer of SIM cards to this phone was easy and fast, since the phone was unlocked already.  My only complaint is that the battery health of the device is at 87%.  When you get below 90 you start to notice, and in this case, it’s easy to do that.  The phone drops a full 100% charge rather quickly.  The price was low enough, that investing in a new battery is worth it.  That’s my only complaint.  All and all this was a good deal and a good quality iPhone 8.",3
203,"Overall, I've been very pleased with this refurbed phone. It was delivered in like new condition and until recently has acted like new. Recently, the phone's charging receptacle stopped working without finagling the connector. I have tried 3 different Apple branded charging wires and chargers and it's the same with all 3. I have to insert and re-insert the Lightning wire several times, hold it just right, carefully place it at an angle and set a weight on the phone by the connector. Only then will it charge. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty and I'm sure it will be too expensive to fix. So I guess when I can no longer find the sweet spot to charge it, I'll look for another refurbished iPhone.On a side note, for my daughter, I bought an identical refurbished phone at the same time (different vendor, but I don't think that matters here), and it's working perfectly.",4
204,"Phone arrived early with a note that its a small business. All seemingly huge bonuses set up for a 5 star review but the phone doesn't work. It will not recognize my phone number, only apple id and only on wifi.Emailed rep as the note said before leaving review. their response was to question if it's user error. Reset the phone as suggested. read apple forums to troubleshoot. turned on and off imessage. restarted, reset again. No apologies from the ""customer service."" Seems like they erased data from a broken phone to sell as refurbished. Huge disappointment",1
205,"The phone is exactly as described. Works great!It has a small scratch on the screen and a couple chipped spots on the bottom from being dropped before I got it. But that’s expected and does not effect functionality.Customer service was great!!Somewhere along the shipping route the package was cut open, the phone was removed from the box and was put back into the package and taped shut. I had to contact seller about the missing phone.Seller was fantastic. I got an answer fast and they graciously sent a replacement (that made it to me this time) without charging me for another phone! Thank you very much!Very happy with my order. 😁",5
206,I read many other bad reviews but mostly because of the seller they got them from I heard the phones not being unlocked or in a certain case 1 blacklisted and some just down right complained about features they didn’t include such as headphones (which was in the description not included) mines came in this generic normal box and had like 2 very small scratches very unnoticeable til I looked hard while I cleaned my finger prints off the phone but I tested the for carrier lock or black list and the phone was in great condition unlocked as advertised 92% battery this phone almost looked brand new just be cautious of your sellers because when u chose a phone different options of sellers provide your choice as well but other than that I rate ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ felt like I got a great deal for a great price very satisfied,5
207,"After a many moons with my I phone 6 it was time for a new phone.  I shopped and researched.  Quickly, one realizes a refurbished phone is the best deal.  However I was afraid of the SIM Card thing and got cold feet.  Many have told me how easy it is so I did it.  Wow it is easy,  You kick yourself for being afraid of something so easy.  Since I do not have large data on my phone I just repeated my contacts and I LOVE MY REFURBISHED I Phone 8  It is as clean as a new one.  Works much better with reception and hearing quality",5
208,"It’s a great phone. My other iPhone was small and broken. This is slightly bigger so that’s nice. It works great. You have to sign for the package, so be home when it’s delivered or they won’t leave it. I’m using it now to write this, so I can tell you it works great. When I got it I just popped out the SIM card from my old phone, so I personally didn’t have to go to the phone store. Maybe you will have to go in, maybe not, I’m not sure. But my experience was great. Thanks!",5
209,UPDATE: IT WAS FRAUDULENTLY UNLOCKEDIt’s an Apple iPhone 8 it’s as expected. Amazon rejected my original email which to me was the more important fact that it is like new and I would trust the “Amazon renewed” program. There is no place to review the seller.,1
210,"My concerns when purchasing a refurbished or renewed iPhone would be:- is it what I ordered? Yes, an iPhone 8 with 64 GB.- Are there scratches on the shell? No. Some scratches would have been acceptable, since I would put the phone in a case anyway.- Are there scratches on the glass? No, in fact the phone had a protective film installed (probably by the original owner).- Is the battery in good shape? Sort of. Battery Health, Maximum Capacity reports 82%. That's the only disappointment. I imagine that battery health will vary.",4
211,"I was skeptical again ordering Renewed smartphones off Amazon.  But this time I tried the New Premium renewed iphone 8 unlocked Gold.  The phone was perfect, not a flaw anywhere on the device, came with a new shark charger and cable.  Everything works perfect and battery health and performance is as promised.  I've been using it daily for almost 2 months, comes with a one year 100% satisfaction warranty.  Hope Amazon keeps adding more phones to their Premium line, seems they are batter than the regular renewed phones.",5
212,iPhone 8 will not setup for Verizon because vender flashed Verizon software off. Will not take SIM card.  Sending phone back to vender.,5
213,"This Renewed Premium phone was perfect! I actually bought 2 - one quite literally looked like it had never even been used. Not one scratch or ding.  Battery capacity 100%. FANTASTIC. The other one had one tiny little ding that I really wouldn't have seen if I wasn't searching hard, and 92% battery capacity. Both function perfectly. Came with a charger and a MFI certified cord. I'm so happy I found these Amazon-backed used phones! It took all of the risk out of the transaction and I couldn't be happier with the result! Buying my teens used phones on amazon from now on!",5
214,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted an iPhone for a long time. The phone was in really nice condition. It did have an 1 1/4” slight scratch on the screen, but once I put on the tempered glass screen protector on you could barely even notice it. All functions of the phone are in working order. Very happy with this purchase.",5
215,This was a stolen phone!!!!!,1
216,"Great prompt service my iPhone gold arrived as described on Amazon here, well packaged ready with a screen protector all around the cell phone is in a very good condition everything functional hundred percent copying my previous iPhone 6s to this iPhone 8 was a breeze and only took 40 minutes I’m super happy with the purchase, I would highly recommend this seller you can tell they respect The customers and sending the item well packed with care and love, on the other hand I order from a different seller here on Amazon a black iPhone 8 256 GB and it was in a horrible condition completely muddy and dirty he was a shame to even open it and try activated by return that the following day. The seller send me a grapevine in a very good price, if you don’t feel like dropping $800-$900 on a new phone as I have done in my last two iPhones I would highly recommend purchasing it from here as I am super happy, and I am very careful when it comes to electronics purchasing online, thank you Amazon I appreciate your business and thanks for amazing product.",5
217,Recieved the phone fast and at first it was working great. Then out of nowhere on the very first day the device shut itself off and then locked itself into a reboot loop. Could not set the device into revovery mode using a hard reset and the device would not connect to itunes for a system restore. Very dissapointing after waiting a week to get the phone to have it fail so badly less then 24 hours after startup.,1
218,"I know this might sound weird, but I NEVER thought I would get an iPhone. I have been team Android since my first smartphone, but necessity made me have to make the switch, so I decided to start safe with this refurbished one.My experience has been great so far. Mine didn't come with any instructions, but you can pretty much figure out how to get it powered up and ready to go. the phone has lots of security settings and have been easy to maneuver.So far so good for me. Looking forward to the possibilities ahead.",5
219,"I received my product on 05/21/20 and it upon opening my package, everything seemed okay. I went to turn on the phone and it seemed dead. No biggie, I could charge it and it’ll work. Wrong.The first red flag: the plastic covering on the charger was loose and came off of the metal attachment to the chord. I was able to slide it up and down the actual wire.Second red flag: I had put the phone on the charger and left for about 30 minutes, expecting my newly unboxed purchase to be nearly charged. Wrong.The phone didn’t even turn on. I had it charging for two hours, tried multiple power-up techniques, all to no success. My phone is faulty. It’s just a lifeless piece of glass and metal.I won’t get into the shipping because that’s another story. But after shipping delays and paying additional shipping charges, it’s a little frustrating receiving a phone I can’t even use. I will be returning the device tomorrow and will not be ordering from this seller again.I should have taken the negative reviews seriously. Maybe if there wasn’t a pandemic my order would have been fulfilled, but I can’t take that chance again.",1
220,"I bought this phone for my teen grandson. When I bought it, the estimated delivery time was 2-3 weeks. That wasn’t an issue as he has a phone, though it’s condition wasn’t great, and he didn’t know this was coming. But, it shipped in about 24 hours and was there within 4 days. He has had several days and when I asked how he would rate the quality of this phone and company, he immediately said 5/5. Way to go!",5
221,Physical condition almost perfect and very happy with that. Screen perfect. Did not know would have. Anew battery and it does not last very long. Battery life shows 84 in settings. Gets down to 20-30% and then super quickly depleted remaining battery life in matter of minutes of use. If battery was replaced with new before selling these refurbished phones it would be an excellent deal. As is you can consider it a decent deal I expect a year or two out of the phone...,4
222,I was a bit hesitant with this purchase because of the mixed reviews but I ended up buying it . It came in just today and works perfectly fine. The phone came without any scratches and without any trouble connected with Cricket easily . I ordered the phone full unlocked and based on others reviews was a bit scared of getting it with another company or getting it not unlocked. The phone came in with a charger but no headphones. You'll have to use your own tool when it's time to remove the sim card. Overall for right now the phone works fine but will update the review if any problems come in the few days.,5
223,"Hi guys, I got the phone, it was unlocked as advertised, no problem for my carrier and I am in Europe. The phone works good for me, I've had it for a couple of days, although the battery capacity is at 89%, it can hold up to 2, 2 and a half days with talking and surfing, no charging. It doesn't restart, as some comments here say, which was what I was worried about and really the value for money is great. Apart from a couple of dinges on the side, visually the phone was great, it even had a protector on. For the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at 100%, just go change it, it's like 20 bucks and don't forget this is not a brand new phone, so for a refurbished phone that I got I can say I am pleased.",4
224,"Shipping was super fast, arriving a day early. The phone was in good condition, as described. There is an area of scratches on the screen, but it’s in the top right and not on the actual touchscreen area; with a screen protector they’re not even viable. Everything works perfectly so far, and battery life is superior to my previous phone’s battery that was only about a year old.I was absolutely thrilled to find they included a screen protector in the box. I don’t remember seeing that mentioned in what was included, but it absolutely made my day since it meant I didn’t have to run out to get one or order one and wait for it to arrive. That little bit of thoughtfulness on the seller’s part completely won me over on the whole transaction, and really impressed me.",5
225,"This phone is great. We are on fixed incomes and didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money to upgrade from our iPhone 6. So, we purchased this refurbished phone from Amazon and have been very pleased. The phone, although used, looks absolutely brand new and operates like a new phone as well. We were so pleased with the phone I got, that my husband bought a similar one from Amazon just last week. Thank you for making options like this available for people who don't need, want, or can afford the latest and greatest gadgets.",5
226,Great product! Arrived on time and functions beautifully.,5
227,"This is going to be an accurate, unbiased review of the phone, so hear me out.The phone's that are received by each person will most definitely be different. My experience went as follows.Upon receiving the phone the right side of the screen was popping up a little, and if it was pushed down into the phone it would cause a blemish to appear in the middle of the phone. No biggie, I just need it to perform basic actions and not die. Here's where the second issue comes in to play. Upon receiving the phone the battery was already at 70% integrity. After the 90-day warranty that integrity was below 50, and now my phone has turned off and refuses to charge. I still have my old phone so this isn't too much of an issue, however now I'm out 240+ dollars and an iPhone.I realize beggars can't be choosers, but you're honestly much better off getting a refurbished phone from a store.",2
228,Esto es muy extraño ya que no está empacado en una caja de Apple.,2
229,"I was mostly surprised with how quick/ responsive this phone was despite it being relatively old, as far as computer electronics are concerned. I got the amazon certified renewed phone, didn't have any problems with sound quality, my screen was in great condition - no cracks, came with a protector on it. Phone worked great. I returned it within 30 days as I changed my mind dropping $$ on this but it was pretty nice, and not a bad experience with amazon certified refurbished at all.",5
230,"I purchased this for my son (high school student), and he hadn’t used the phone camera from the beginning. After a while, he started to use it, then realized the camera couldn’t work. The screen kept on dithering while taking photos or videos, couldn’t focus. We tried many ways to solve this problem, unfortunately when we reached to the seller, it’s already passed 90 days, they chose to ignore my request for help. We couldn’t get any solution, very disappointing.",1
231,"Very happy with this phone purchase. I have had it for almost a year. When I got it the battery was amazing. It held a charge for a very long time. I could do several things, streaming, taking video, texting, calling, etc. without having to recharge. And then one day like it had a switch it went from excellent to very, very poor. Seriously, from one day to the next. When batteries die it is normally a gradual thing. It makes me suspicious of Apple. That is not RENEWED CELLULAR'S fault whom I bought the phone from, they sold an excellent product, that battery problem is on Apple.",5
232,"The sim card tray was extremely hard to get out.  Then I realized my phone came in with 84% battery life.  I didn’t realize that a battery should be replaced at 80 percent.  Had I realized, I would have passed on this seller.  Refurbished is one thing.  Bad battery life is another.  They were pretty arrogant in their email.  So BEWARE!  Your phone could come almost needed a replaced battery.My sister bought a refurbished phone from Amazon from another seller for around the same price and her battery life is 98%.  So I’d recommend shopping around!",1
233,"So glad I trusted the positive comments for the seller BuySPRY! My iphone 8 looked like brand new and has been working great! Even came with a durable screen protector! The generic lightning cable and power brick look and perform just like authentic products. What a great way for me to get an iPhone for work without having to spend the $$ for the newest model. For $199, I now have an iphone for work so that I can check email and calendar. I still use my Android, but my work only allows iPhones for exchange access due to Apple's stringent security updates. Battery life is great. All in all, exceeds my expectations so far!",5
234,"After setting up all my contacts because they did not transfer over , made a call only to find that the person could not hear me, checked the mute , still no sound. Very flustering , after all the time spent setting it up; Sent it back the next day, they need to verify the mic works before saying completely refurbed.  Note, I did confirm with carrier the phone was detected and was able to make calls, tested with them to be sure , I could here them , but they could not hear me",1
235,"I wanted to gift my sister a phone for her birthday and I bought this refurbished phone. It was not as expected. There is a scratch on the screen which is fairly visible. The battery life is not that good either. The battery health is at 75%, and for iphone 8 the phone dies so quick. The charger that came with it is of bad quality too. Fingerprint reader works like half of the time only. So basically everything I received were of low quality. Not satisfied with my purchase.",1
236,"I upgraded from an iphone 6, to an iphone 8 after the announcement of the iphone 11 price drop, because with ios13 they finally stopped supporting the 6. All I do on my phone is check email, chat on telegram, take photos and watch youtube. I'm not a power user, so the main difference I noticed was everything became more responsive, faster, and the battery lasts much longer. The transfer process was pretty easy through itunes. No complaints, I stuck with apple out of sheer convenience, and I'll probably continue to stay with apple as long as they don't remove the fingerprint reader in future models.",5
237,"Just as any kids is, he is hard on a phone so I worry how long it is going to last. I'm not sure about the battery life being as good as my samsung. He does seem to charge it more than I do mine and I have asked him once or twice he no answer my call and he say his battery is low. Don't recall having that issue when he had a samsung. Still all the features seem to work fine except for the wifi calling. We ive in the country and respection is not the best so wifi calling is something we do at home. I used his phone the other day because I couldn't find mine and the call I was on dropped three times. Was not pleased with that. I even took the time to go find mine to finish my call.",3
238,"I am really blown away by this purchase. It arrived three days early, in PRISTINE condition.  I work remotely, so having a device that cooperates is essential.  The sound quality is out of this world, with the storage capacity of 256GB I am off the walls happy!!!!! I am the Director of a Public High School and am on my phone constantly.  The speed and again STORAGE is unbelievable.  I would recommend looking into the seller of the various negative comments that were left in order to tease out who to purchase from.  This device was sold through KISS Electronics.  You'll see they have overwhelmingly positive reviews.  Happy to answer any questions.  Couldn't be happier!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
239,"I ordered the fully unlocked version. When it came in the mail it was in new condition, no scratches or dings, and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out. We have a plan with Verizon, I was able to take out my sim from my old IPhone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues. My phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone. So far no bugs or glitches. I'm very happy with my purchase. There were a lot of mixed reviews so I was skeptical on buying it but I'm glad I did! Plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective I didn't feel like I would loose my money. My advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version.",5
240,"I have a love hate relationship with Apple. I will not buy a new product from them ever. Why? They brick phones with updates. That's shady. They smile while they do it too. So? Well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones. Prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn't affect my choice of where my cash goes. What does have some weight in my decision making is customer service. I pay the asking price I get a device as advertised. Simple enough right? You would be surprised or maybe you wouldn't. The local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don't seem to get what good customer service is. So.... okay. Get to the point right? I got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and I didn't have to deal with anyone so that's a plus. However, the appearance of the item was ummm .... acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector. The peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and I'm sure feeling slightly used.Have I mentioned it prior to this post? Nope. It really wouldn't matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn't as expected. Customer Service guys. Don't just don't. Will I buy another when the time comes? Yup. Whatta ya do? Smile and count your blessings these days I guess. It could always be worse.",3
241,"I had people complain that they couldn't hear me when I called them, so I started using my Bluetooth headset and all was good.  Then I found I could use speaker phone mode but it didn't work well. Finally I took it to the Genius bar and it turned out the microphones on the bottom of the phone are dead.  Repair cost is $350, which is the cost of the phone.Needless to say I am not going to buy from this vendor again.",2
242,"I'm afraid the only good thing I can say was the FexEx shipping.  Overwise, here we go.  First the phone came DOA on arrival, completely discharged.  Secondly the housing was replaced with a cheap Chinese reproduction.  Lastly the Screen had several major flaws, that held at two arms length could be easily seen.  Finally I will say battery heath was a disappointing 86%  This phone is at best worth $130-40 dollars.  It is a iphone and it has 256gb flash  that is the only high point.  I do not like to give bad reviews, but well I am a bit upset that seller under estimated me and expected me to  be happy.",1
243,"Ordered this phone and was very excited! I was even more excited when I received it because it looked brand new!Charged it overnight... Went to 100%. Unplugged it the AM and phone died about 2 minutes later (Not exaggerating).I thought I didn't charge it and repeated the process. Put to charge, went to work. Came back. Said 100%. Unplugged... Dead less than 2 min later.Packed it and returned.Will order a 2nd one once I get my refund to give it a 2nd try",1
244,"I had to have a new phone and this was my best deal. I really like it, but am still getting adjusted to it. It keeps moving the Icons around so  I have to search for them.( I assume this is Apple and not the phone(.This is very annoying and I can't figure out why and how to stop it.  sometimes it just eliminates an Icon. I still can't find Facebook, Instagram, and Emails, but I am ""technology challenged"", so perhaps my grandson can help me when he gets out of school!",4
245,"I do wish it had a bigger screen like the newer phones, but it is nice in that it uses the finger print tech where as the newer once require face recognition. I'm not too comfortable with that. Been working great last 6 months. I ordered one with 256gb of memory so I don't run out.",5
246,"Phone was in near perfect condition. Packaging was basic, but that’s a good thing - Less waste than original Apple packaging. Popped in SIM card from old Verizon phone, turned on, and booyah - worked perfectly. My daughter has been using for over a month now and no issues at all.I will probably be buying a lot of phones for the family in the future through a refurbished seller like this.Shipping was a bit slow, and the tracking didn’t update until it was literally in the mailbox, but that’s probably due to the Christmas rush - still received it in time for Christmas morning, so no complaints.",5
247,I was so concerned reading the reviews on the refurbished iPhone eights. I became even more concerned when it took a few days longer to get here. But when it got here I was so happy to see it was in pristine condition and had a 100% battery life. It also was able to be used with any Service provider just like the description claimed. If I ever need to buy another phone I will definitely go through this same company Mobilsupply as my distributor.,5
248,"When I bought the phone It would turn off randomly, just with normal use, now after 3 months of use the phone will not even turn on anymore. I have tried charging it, resetting it and literally every trick in the book to turn it back on but nothing works. I got a defective product and should have returned it as soon as I started having issues with it which was from day one.",1
249,"I love the iPhone 8 itself (I got one on release; this one was meant to replace a larger screen phone that I couldn’t get used to), but unfortunately this “renewed” phone wasn’t up to par. The description says minimal to no visible wear; however, the inch long gouge smack in the middle of the screen says otherwise. There are tons of micro-scratches all over the screen visible when held at an angle to light, but the gouge is way too distracting and obvious all the time (screen on or off, even looking straight on) so unfortunately I had to return it. I should have known the price was too good to be true.",2
250,"Do your homework.  When you get the phone, check the serial number (several sites online) to make sure it is not blacklisted.  Anytime you buy a renewed or used phone, you should do that. Do that before you insert the sim card and try to use the phone.Had some minor issues, at first... cleaning with spray air, cotton swabs and alcohol took care of all of them.Had to clean the lightening port, to get it to charge.The sound was not very loud.  Cleaned the ear piece slit at the top of the face, and the speaker holes at the bottom.  Shockingly, that fixed all the sound issues!  Then it was loud.  Had to turn the sound down, after... EVEN!Well worth the purchase and the value.  Be patient, work through the small issues, and it will pay off.  Would purchase one again.  (4 stars instead of 5 for the small issues.  Very happy, though)",4
251,The iPhone came packaged as if it was brand new.  Transfer of data from iPhone 6 was easy and complete.  I purchased a second iPhone 8 for my my wife and it too was in pristine condition.  The Verizon sales rep who did the transfer of info also believes that they both were new.  Great deal and an excellent upgrade for us and our needs.,5
252,"I purchased this unlocked iPhone 8 to replace my daughter’s iPhone 6S. It arrived on time, in great condition and exactly as described as advertised. The maximum battery capacity (viewed in Battery Health setting) showed 85% on unboxing which is expected for a phone that’s three years old. I have two boys that both have the iPhone 8 Plus and it’s consistent with their Battery Health. I put my daughter’s Verizon SIM card in the renewed iPhone 8 and haven’t had any issues. I would say this was a great purchase for the price. I could have got a similar deal from Verizon but I like the 90 day purchase warranty provided by Amazon.",5
253,"Overall this product was very well working! No visible scratches on my phone and upon arrival the battery health was at 96%, however the shutter noise for the camera will not turn off leading me to believe that this product originated from another country.",3
254,"I've only had the phone for several days but it seems fine.  What was amazing is that you can transfer via Bluetooth all your photos and contacts, everything from your old phone, iPhone 6, to the new phone and then just remove and swap the SIM card.  Done.  Didn't have to go to the AT&T place at all.",5
255,"Phone looks like new, problem is the camera has black screen and I took it to Apple tech, said it’s water damaged and that feature can’t be repaired. Now I have to return it.",1
256,"This was supposed to be an upgrade over my Samsung j2. The phone runs smooth, the camera and the speakers are a slight upgrade. However, the user interface annoys me. (this isn’t my first iPhone) The whole Bluetooth headphones is a lesser experience and finally the battery. This phone dies in 3.5 hours. It’s incredibly inconvenient and a little stressful. I think it’s just the quality the provider sold me. It says in the battery menu that the phone can only hold 69% of the maximum charge. I am for sure not giving Apple another $50 to change the battery to make it slightly better. Once again, who would pay almost $200 for a phone that dies in 3.5 hours? Very poor quality. I will gladly keep my old phone and take my money back. Update: within the first 24 hours it randomly turned off and when I turned it back on I had to reboot it to get service back.",1
257,"This phone is fantastic. My 12yr old really wanted an iPhone and we weren't going to pay Apple prices for one. It arrived in great condition and looked brand new.She has had it for around a month now, so I feel more confident leaving a review. We have had no issues with it whatsoever. Battery life could be better.The phone came with a charging cable that didn't work and seller was very quick to send a replacement out to us.  Great purchase so far.",5
258,"i purchased an iphone 8 -256GB which arrived oct 2,2020.  Tried to swap my phone to it and got error. Due to covid illnesses (family members) and other issues i sat this aside for a better time. In March,2021 i took to AT+T store and the device failed to activate for them also.  Took to yet another store 4/21 and it failed to active, and they did latest software update. Still wont work. Apple said it was a motherboard problem -primarily BaseBand IC.  Its unfixable.  The return policy is over, but .... am trying to find if i can get some refund.  Delays were my fault but the iphone is not usable.",1
259,"This has been the first time I tried buying a refurbished phone, and I was a bit nervous about, but I have been really happy about it.I received the phone, and it looks as good as new, no scrathes etc. It did not come with the original charger from apple, but that was not really a problem.I have not noticed anything not functioning, or being slightly off. Battery life seems great, I have had no technical problems with it. I also did not have any problems with connecting to my sim card and phone company, I have T-Mobile.I think it is a great way to save some money on what is already a pretty expensive phone brand, and I can recommend doing this.",5
260,"I was able to transfer all my information from my old iPhone 6 to this phone without issue.  Had so far about 2 weeks and it is so good so far. If issues arise I will update unless issues start 3-4 years down the road.  If phone is good for you that period of time then it is time to get another one anyway.  Apple would have updated their system several times by then and this iPhone 8 will be out of date and system maxed past this phone’s usage. Same is about to happen to the iPhone 6.  Battery was issue I had with old iPhone, this iPhone has 100% battery health so far.  So so far so good.Some people just have an unrealistic idea of what they are buying. It is a Re manufactured or freshened up iphone. It is not a brand new phone and you are not asked to pay new iPhone 8 price now are you.",5
261,"The Iphone 8 arrived looking like brand new. It even came with screen protector. However, fingerprint sensor did not work. I spent a couple of hours setting and resetting the phone with no luck and just ended up returning it. I didn't test any other phone functions thus have no comments whether other features are in working order. Since the phone did not perform as described, I had to give it lower rating. But I went with 3 stars since the return process was painless. They provided a prepaid UPS label. I got refund less than 1 week after I shipped it back. I will be ordering another phone and hopefully have better luck this time around.",3
262,Phone is in excellent cosmetic condition with three exceptions. 1. The home button is recessed below the surface of the face plate and it isn't centered. It works but has a much different feel from my other iphone. 2. There is a large dark spot on the top right of the screen. 3 The battery life is 85% which is my reason for getting a different iphone.  The description stated Renewed (New). I suspect the screen has been replaced as well. I will be returning the phone tomorrow..,2
263,"Pro's: Phone came within 2 days. Which was incredible and much sooner than expected.Phone was in excellent cosmetic condition. No knicks or dents or scratches. Beautiful condition.Con: this is my first ever iphone. After dealing with the pain in the @$$ ID set up and transfer from android to apple with my carrier... The battery was the biggest disappointment. The battery went from 60% to 11% within a couple MINUTES.NOW, i will be out the phone, the money i spent for a couple days and having to transfer everything back over, drop off to mail back.. Needless to say i should have been more suspicious of the previous comments on the battery life.Have one more phone coming and wondering now if I'll have the same issue. So disappointed..IF I knew for certain i would not have this battery issue again, i would purchase again. The shipment was super fast and again, the physical appearance of the phone was fantastic. But big no on the battery life.",2
264,"I bought this as an upgrade for my iPhone 5s. I had problems with the phone from day one, but since I had brought it back with me to Peru, it was $50-70 to return the phone. I decided to hold onto it and try it out longer. The phone started working again for a few weeks and then stopped working. Then, after a reset, it worked again perfect for a few more weeks. Now the phone won't stay on for more than several minutes and I'm back to using my iPhone 5 and past the warranty. I should have returned it but that ship has sailed. They don't seem to be checking these phones very well in my opinion, you are better off buying a refurbished phone from Apple which is slightly more expensive but offers better support and a longer more reliable warrenty.",1
265,"Buyer beware! The phone arrived really looking great, almost unblemished however it started having screen issues i.e. dark screen, sadly, right after the 90 day warranty expired. I've bought this for my aging mother-in-law that lives far from me. I've had my reservations prior to purchasing it for this simple fact but I thought I'd take a chance and hope the seller would be helpful if something does happen but clearly that's not the case. So if you don't want the headache and money to burn, don't do it.",2
266,"Siri does not work and causes serious crashes.  I can use the Home button for anything but Siri.  When I use it for voice text or reminders, the phone will do one function and then go into vapor lock, requiring several reboots and a timeout (power down) for at least 10 minutes to work again.  In the past I depended on Siri a lot, so it has been a big problem. And then I missed my 90-day guarantee window to get the problem resolved.  Know why?  Because I didn't have Siri to remind me to get it done in time.  This has been a sad waste of $300.",1
267,"NEVER purchase from this CHUBBIES TECH! My son purchased a refurbished phone and 6 months later the microphone and FaceTime no longer work. When we brought it to the Apple Store, they informed us the phone had been serviced 4 separate times with previous owners. We had NO idea! Dealers selling refurbished items should be required to disclose this information to potential buyers. The dealer, Chubbies Tech is standing by their 90 day policy and not offering any help. WASTE OF MONEY!!",1
268,"Buy this phone and waste your money. Receive it broken and return it, and the seller will tell you that YOU broke it.It was turning itself off since we received it. It eventually stopped turning on all together. THEY ARE TELLING US THAT THEY WILL NOT GIVE OUR MONEY BACK WHICH WE NEED TO GET A NEW PHONE. They already have the phone back. You. Will. Waste. Your. Money on this one. This needs to be taken DOWN! They just want to steal your money. I DEMAND A REFUND!",1
269,Bought last December today the screen would not turn on it's just dark grey never been dropped always been in a case I contacted Amazon said they won't help me sent me my receipt and told me contact the manufacture the manufacture says they can't help it's a refurbished phone from Amazon and I would have to pay for the part and fix it myself or send it in and pay whatever the cost ends up being just doesn't seem right to not replace or refund a iphone just bought 9 months ago,1
270,"Although I got the wrong size, (I thought that I had ordered the Plus size), it is a good product overall.",5
271,"I got the phone and the battery was very bad. I needed the phone but couldn't use because of the battery, it wouldn't last so i checked and it had a request on the settings, saying it needed a replacement for the battery. i didn't do it because it wasn't worth it, also the camera just stopped working.",1
272,"I've only had my phone for a day, but right now it looks perfect. There's a very small scratch on the outside of the phone but that's about it. The screen is fine, I was able to set it up easily, and there's been no issues thus far. Was pretty scared about getting it at first because of the bad reviews and how awful they said it was, but it worked out great for me. Charger works as well. Hope it works out for anyone else planning on buying it. Oh, also I got it three days early, so that was a huge plus. I kept looking at the tracking just waiting for it to get here lol.",5
273,"I almost never write reviews--I think it's worth doing so here.  Many of them here scared me.  But, given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold, I took the plunge and bought the product.  I waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here.  It arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left-hand corner that I really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place.  Within 48 hours, I made a larger blemish to the poor R2D2 when I dropped it screen-side-down on my hard floors in my apartment  Luckily, the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn't affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party,  I guess, so the disaster mostly was avoided.  This experience made me come to terms with the fact that it's only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode.  Pro Tip: I highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don't end up like me.The iPhone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator, who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision.  In all seriousness, I am thrilled with this purchase  Apple designed them to be slippery.  See that you buy a screen protector.",5
274,"Absolutely thrilled with this iPhone. It is beautiful. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it. I have a Samsung Galaxy S9, and am considering making the switch to iPhone because I like this one so well. Everything works great, and it shipped really fast. It was a bit difficult to hook up to Straight Talk, so I would recommend just calling their customer service once you receive a SIM card from them.",5
275,"Received the phone and it seemed ok at first. The IOS was about 3 major versions old so I tried to update it, but for some reason it couldn’t.  Long story short, after several hours of trying to fix it and a few more with apple support, it was determined that the hardware was bad. Seems like this could have been determined when doing their QA, but I’m guessing they don’t do much if any. On top of all this after finding out that they sent me a bad phone, I had to pay for the return myself.  Happy ending is that I found the same exact phone for about $30 cheaper on another site and this one worked!",1
276,"So I bought this phone mainly because it had a warranty but watch out. 20 days before the warranty ended I contacted them about the phones camera not working and that the phone would shut off and not turn back on for days at time.They apparently emailed asking for the IEMI number which I wouldn’t be able to get since the phone wouldn’t turn on, and I missed the email probably because it went to spam and was not able to provide this information so I wrote them again.So even though I started the conversation and reported issues well within their warranty period and now it’s past their warranty period their response has switched to good luck, take it to a repair shop it’s out of warranty.Spend your money somewhere else if you value it!!!",1
277,"The battery was supposed to be at 80% I believe, it was not.  Right off the bat the battery had to be replaced.  The phone is sub par and little to no upgrade from the i6 that I was using.One of my main reasons for upgrading to the i8 was for a better battery life, it's actually worse even with the new battery.  But once you move everything over and pay for the battery it's too late to return.",3
278,Fingerprint works greatBattery life is at 91%There's a really small faint scratch at the back of the phone . Nothing major. I seriously  dont mind at all barley noticable.The phone was actually  sim unlocked  i got it activated  with AT&T. Great buyI bought it as a gift my sister will love it. It was a great affordable price I was looking for nice phone as cheap as possible you provided it thank you,5
279,"I love my new phone! The battery life lasts tremendously longer than my old iPhone SE. it runs smoothly, charges quickly and stays charged, and is the perfect size! I highly recommend buying this phone. I have already recommended to friends looking to get new phones. Unbeatable for what you get!PS mine even came with a charger chord and charger wall outlet.",5
280,The phone was in fantastic shape. Even had a clean screen protector on it (may have been on there from the previous owner). I’ll update in a few months if there are any issues. So far so good. Phone is unlocked. I got it for a parent that has MetroPCS. I had to call customer service and had them activate it by giving them the IMEI that can be found here : General>Settings>About,5
281,"The battery life of the phone I got is very very poor, you need to charge it like twice a day- I don’t recommend buying from this seller at all. The phone you get is scratched up and looks really used. The fingerprint doesn’t work and you just end up putting your passcode in every time you want to get into your phone. It’s not worth your money.",2
282,"Replacing a very grumpy android phone, about time my ""other half"" is introduced to the world of iPhone! haha. Phone showed up in the amazon packaging with off brand cord and plugin like it was supposed to. No scratches or dings that I could find and it came right on, seems to hold charge perfectly fine as well.Only complaint is user fault and not the phone, issues figuring out how to use it haha.",5
283,"I thought this would be a renewed phone, as in, any issues from previous use would be fixed before it was sold to me. Nope. Screen has noticeable imperfections, battery is at 85% capacity, speaker crackles when playing music, and people say it sounds like I’m standing next to a waterfall when I call them. So the best I can say is that it is a functioning, if poorly, iPhone. The seller offers a refund, but I will have to buy another phone to use before I can send this one back.",2
284,"Was initially concerned from other reviews as to the quality and validity of the product, but was pleasantly surprised. The phone works well and has been working well for some time. Even the battery life isn't that bad, all things considered. Will most certainly buy again.",5
285,"This is the second refurbished iPhone that I purchased from Hybrid IT on Amazon. I purchased from Hybrid IT because of their excellent customer satisfaction rating. I bought the iPhone 8 as a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she loved it. The phone arrived on time, was well packaged and in perfect condition. It looked like new, not a scratch on it. It worked perfectly and when the SIM card was added, was set up on a cell phone plan with no issues. The battery health was 90% which is great for a refurbished phone.",5
286,"The phone I purchased proved to be unusable as it was stolen and blacklisted from network use. When I contacted support, they simply did not acknowledge that the phone was stolen, and after three days simply asked if I'd received shipping labels to send it back, which I took as a tacit admission that they are well aware many of their renewed phones are from unscrupulous sources. I never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways.  I strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable, at least for me. Hopefully in the future Kiss Electronics can find a way to take better care of their future customers than I was taken care of, because this transaction could hardly have gone more wrong for me and I'm incredibly disappointed.",1
287,"El vendedor envió el teléfono bloqueado con una clave de seis dígitos y no informó, tuve que pagar $30 para desbloquearlo, además la publicación dice:Este anuncio incluye:1 - Apple iPhone 8, desbloqueado1 funda protectora transparente con absorción de impactos.1 - Soporte ajustable y plegable.1 cargador de coche USB 3.0 de carga rápida.1 - Cable Lightning de carga adicional1 - Cubo de alimentación USB adicional1 paño de microfibra de limpieza.De lo cual sólo trajo el iPhone 8, cable USB y cubo de alimentación.Deben ser más transparentes con lo que publican y con lo que en realidad envían al cliente.",5
288,"If I could give this product and vendor a zero I would. It is a renewed phone and they obviously didn’t do much to fix it. After three and a half months, the home button stopped working and it’s having all sorts of problems. They just said that it’s only warranted for three months and wouldn’t do anything when I contacted them just a couple weeks after that. They refurbish products just enough to get you through 3 months and then wash their hands of it. I would buy from another vendor who will stand behind their products. Very poor customer service!",1
289,"I bought this for my Wife because I had bought one just like it a month ago. Mine pretty much set itself up, it was totally painless. She has had this thing since Christmas and still can’t get it set up. Apparently an update has not be done and because of that it is kinking the whole set up process. However it won’t allow the update to be done now for some reason. Beins how this phone is a refurbished maybe that’s the reason it was sent back. I think she has given up on it so it looks like I will need to get involved. I’ll keep you all posted on how it turns out.",2
290,"Phone was fine for the first few months and then the battery life rapidly decreased.At the 8 month mark it would only stay charged for a few hours and now at 10 months it's dead, won;t even turn on. Apple advised that it most likely was a defective battery and needs to be refurbished or replaced. Total bummer. It died before I get get a backup completed - I now have a sad teenage daughter that won't talk to me anymore :(",2
291,"I gotta be honest I didn't expect to get a damn near perfect iPhone 8.It was sim locked to AT&T but less than 15 minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone I was able to insert my sim card then use it on the CricketWireless service.There is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn't a problem because a case would cover it up easily. Other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else, battery is great, no Cloud lock and everything functions normally.I don't know if I got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 90 day warranty is a plus.Thank you for blessing me with a phone I could give to my mom cuz she loves having TouchID and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too (even though she's never going to use it).",5
292,"I've had a great experience purchasing from this seller. I had to return the phone because of some rear camera issues, but the seller was fully cooperative and very helpful. Therefore, although I had to spend time on the setting-up of the phone (and the subsequent erasure of my data), the stress was mitigated by the responsiveness of the seller and their willingness to replace the item with a fully satisfying phone. I'll definitely work with the seller again. I am assured that if there's anything wrong with the phone, the seller will make sure to replace it with an item that is satisfactory and without any defect.",5
293,"I purchased iPhone 8 64GB fully unlocked for my oldest one, he uses without phone service.He likes it because he can join the group chat through iMessage with his classmates and I like it because I can monitor his usages.the phone seems working decent for a used one.I am planning to get another one for my deaf child as well, because iPhone has a feature to pair hearing devices directly stream, phone calls, movies, music, and etc. its the best for bilateral CI implants.",5
294,"Not Happy with this “renewed” IPhone 8 from AE Cells. According to Amazon, this should be like new, but all 4 corners have damage. The back is heavily scratched. The screen has been replaced with an aftermarket product. The battery health is at 80%, barely meeting the minimum requirement. There’s nothing about this phone that is like new or refurbished. It just looks like someone’s old beat up used phone. Amazon needs to either change the product description or get rid of some third-party sellers.",1
295,I bought this phone about a month and a half ago and it has worked perfectly since I got it. I was very happy to find a phone that was inexpensive (for an iPhone) and actually properly refurbished.,5
296,"As the title says, works as well as the iPhone 7. Replaced it because I thought a problem was hardware related (turned out it wasn’t). Do like the expanded 64 GB memory over the 32 GB memory of the 7 because I can have my entire music library onboard. Use music, podcasts, calendar, all of it. Signing in to my account, the phone filled with all my apps and data. Honestly don’t notice it’s much faster with updated chip and I seldom use the camera, so newer features don’t make a significant difference to me but bottom line is is works as well as I’m used to. Will use it until I upgrade to iPhone 12 when that comes out, so I can be ready for 5G when it really it deployed and working (most places have little to no 5G, regardless of what the ads say).",5
297,Such a good deal.  Thank you,5
298,"I have never left a bad review.  We own two businesses and I get the impact that reviews could have on a company.  It came with a charger and that charger is the only charger the phone worked on.  My 15 year old daughter saved ALL year for this $397 iphone 8.  It lasted 3.5 months.  We went on vacation and she forgot her charger.  By the way, it was still in warranty when we left for vacation.  Her phone would not work with any other iphone charger that we had.  I do not know much about the mechanical part of phones other than how to operate them. We went to a technician on vacation thinking it was the battery. Battery was fine, charge port was fine.  He said the chip was bad on the mother board and to fix it would be significant.  The technician said the seller KNEW this phone had a problem and sold it anyway.  Amazon contacted seller. Seller emailed me it's 2 weeks out of warranty go to a repair shop.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.",1
299,"I got this iPhone for my daughter who has been asking for a iPhone for awhile. I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews. I went ahead and ordered the phone. It arrived early and was in very good condition.  The phone looks new to me. Took it to Metropcs and got it activated with no problems. The only con about this phone is the battery health, which was at 84%. Other than that I’m completely satisfied. My daughter loves it. I bought it from the seller Hybrid IT.",5
300,"This is my 1st iPhone, even though 'only an 8', it is so much better in so many ways than all other cell phones I've had. Able to do so many things not ever able to do before. And Siri a time saver and facilitator of immense capacity. Even seemingly little things like use of the keyboard functions is better. And I was pleased with the Amazon's price for a refurbished phone",5
301,Who needs a brand new phone? Not me! This phone was like new and the price was right. Works and looks perfect.,5
302,"Received on Friday.  Transferred data and programs from old phone on Sunday.  Will be hooking it up to AT&T on Monday.  So far the phone works well, except the battery seems to discharge rather quickly (possibly a result of too many apps running, but I'll be checking that out soon).  In any event, I am quite pleased with my purchase.",5
303,"My daughter loves her new phone, it was fully unlocked was able to take it to a cell phone store and put a phone line on it for my daughter!  She loves her phone Thanks ❤️❤️ Quality was great perfect condition!!",5
304,"Item arrive on time, well packed and safe box. Item was in a great shape, only a tiny scratch on a side of the cell phone, nothing that anyone can't leave with, even with cover you will never see it.  all good till we start using it, battery life was not good and we just returned it for refund. Great follow up and refund received after item arrived to vendor. thanks.",3
305,"I ordered 2 iPhone 8's from this vendor at a good price.The phones I received work well, but after using them a while we discovered that we were unable to disable the rather loud camera shutter sound.  This is apparently a ""feature"" of Japanese market iPhones due to local laws.  Sure enough, when we find the Model code in the settings, these are Japanese models, even though we are in the U.S.There was no indication that we would receive foreign model phones in the listing, nor how they may differ from US distributed phones.  The listing indicates that the phones are ""For AT&T"", which I believe is a U.S. only network provider.This is somewhat annoying.",3
306,The Bluetooth feature is entirley broken.,1
307,"I bought this phone to replace my grandmas iPhone she had. It came in a bland cardboard box with the phone in bubble wrap and the charging cable and charging wall plug wrapped up nicely but everything could shift around a lot in the box but luckily everything was safe and nothing broken. The batter life of the phone was at 91% meaning that was the max life of the battery so not too bad but a little low for my liking. Decent price, decent phone.",4
308,"Very happy with my purchase! I just “upgraded” from my refurbished,  unlocked iPhone 6 64GB, and this phone is a great value for the money. I could not justify shelling out more than $1,000 for a phone, so after researching i settled on the iPhone 8 64GB in gold.  I shopped around, and decided to purchase on amazon because of  the Amazon Renewed policy, as well as the ability to purchase 2 year accident protection. My phone arrived with a few very light scratches on the screen (as described), which doesn’t bother me one bit as I always add a glass screen protector. The speed and functionality are also perfect, and setup was easy.  The battery life is not as great as expected, but not enough of an issue to decrease the rating. I purchased from BREED. Highly recommend!",5
309,I love my new to me iPhone 8. I’ve always had androids. Not anymore. The phone looked good and felt like brand new. It arrived with a six foot long heavy duty charging cord that I find convenient for those times I need to use my phone while it’s charging. I’d buy this phone from this seller again without hesitation,5
310,This phone came in great condition. No scratches or marks. Easy to set up. But the battery life was horrible. It only had 79% capacity and I couldn’t even get it to charge passed 12% while using it. Lost about 30% of battery life in the ten min I used it. I would have kept the phone if it weren’t for the bad battery. Great packaging and even came with a like new charger. But what good is a phone with out a decent battery.,1
311,The phone arrived clean and in 8.5/10 condition and would be mistaken for brand new if it weren’t for some extremely mild blemishing around the border (like super minor).I have no gripes about the phone so far and am considering another.My experience is obviously not going to be shared across the board and can only vouch for the first week’s impression but…so far so good. Time will tell 🤷🏻,5
312,This phone arrived and appeared as described--like new.  Easily accepted our carrier SIM and worked great....for 6 weeks.  Yesterday the phone suddenly died.  I reached out to amazon and they connected us with Apple.  They tried in vain for an hour to get it working again but couldn't.  Ultimately Amazon accepted it to return (it had the 90 renewed guarantee) and off it went by UPS today.We've had good luck with renewed items and this may have just been a fluke.  But we decided to buy a brand new Apple Xr phone instead.,2
313,The price was fair and the phone is like new. I purchased this phone 8 as it was an upgrade from my 6s and I did not want to pay $600 or $700 for a new phone. Also switched carriers for a 50% savings. All good!,5
314,"Item as described, almost perfect - very satisfied with the quality of this used iPhone 8! Battery life was 86% and not a single scratch or ding! One blemish where the black is there is a white dot but I was expecting a lot worse with some of these reviews. Very satisfied!!! This is a backup phone and a home-line for our kiddos when we need to reach them.",5
315,This phone is not worth buying. The volume for talking on the phone is horrible. I can barely hear people talking to me. The people on the other end of the line are always telling me they can never hear me. When you get your notifications sometimes the sound is quiet sometimes the sound is super loud. When I close out an app and then turn the phone off and then come back to it later the screen will come up with something that I was doing three weeks ago and have since deleted,2
316,The phones were dirty and grimy. Visible scratches on screen. The worst was batter lasted for about an hour on both units. couldnt connect to the data plan of my carrier. Only reason didnt return is because i was able to trade them in for new phones with my carrier since they had a promotion. otherwise they would have gone back,1
317,"The phone itself was in great condition. Minor scratches around the camera but that’s nearly unavoidable with this model. Good battery percentage and a clean IMEIHOWEVER- It seems as though they are using refurbished phones that originate from Japan and Korea. Those places do not allow you to turn off your camera shutter sound whether your phone is on silent with the media all the way down, or you’re using a third party camera. It always makes that super awkward and annoying shutter sound",3
318,I saw multiple reviews talking about how these refurbished phones were horrible and I was skeptical at first but I am glad I took the plunge and purchased this used phone. It is pretty much like new and was shipped clean and ready for setup. No issues with it thus far and battery life seems appropriate. I will certainly do business with this seller again,5
319,"Phone arrived and works, but the battery health is 86%. Unacceptable. Now you're asking the customer to take apart their phone either now or in the next month or so to replace something that should have been taken care of. You're assuming the customers have odd screw drivers like tri-wings. You're assuming the customer can replace the waterproofing measures on this phone just to replace a battery. From now on, you do it. Not Okay.",2
320,"I received the iPhone and it looked fine but when I activated it, I couldn’t hear very well. I took it in to have it checked and they said the speakers had moisture in them. I had to have it repaired. I guess you get what you pay for.",2
321,"I’m a Verizon Prepaid customer and wanted to upgrade phones. I had a little trouble trying to use eBay, so I came to amazon and this was by far the best experience I had with ordering this phone. It came the next day after I ordered it and I only needed to put my SIM card from my iPhone 6 into the new iPhone 8 and it connected right to the network. I didn’t have to go in the store or call a number or anything. Wonderful phone upgrade. It’s much better than the old one. Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade a Verizon prepaid phone.",5
322,"So excited about the condition and the ease of set up with this phone.  I was hesitant to buy a reconditioned phone from Amazon, but it's been great so far.  The price was great too!!!",5
323,Yes the shutter sound can’t be turned off but by just using Live mode to take photos that is resolved. The phone was for my wife and she likes the shutter sound (who knows why?) so zero problem either way. Phone arrived indistinguishable from new. Shiny and scratch free. Setup was easy. SIM card from old phone worked perfectly. Charged extremely fast and battery seems to last a long time. We added the extended warranty. A 256GB phone for less than $300 can’t be beat.,5
324,"I don’t always write reviews but I’m so happy with the condition of the iPhone I got, no visible scratches or dents. I get all my calls and text messages I just put my old at&t SIM card in and it works perfectly. Only downside is battery maximum capacity is 83%. But I feel that is fair enough because the product description says >80% which it is. Don’t buy one of these if you need a better battery life.",5
325,"I WANT TO RETURN THIS PHONE ASAP AND I WANT A REFUND OR ANOTHER PHONE WITH A CREDIT. I HAVE WAITED FOR DAYS FOR THIS PHONE, JUST FOR IT NOT TO WORK!!! THE PHONE DOES NOT WORKS, IT IS NOT UNLOCKED LIKE THE DESCRIPTION SAYS!!!!!!! THE SCREEN IS GONE OUT COMPLETELY, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! YOU CALL THIS SATISFACTORY CUSTOMER SERVICE,BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT SATISFYING!!!!!!!! I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!",1
326,"I was afraid when making this purchase because of all the negative comments, however the purchase went well, the purchase was for my eldest daughter. I recommend the Hybrid IT seller, I loved the cell phone, it is used as new, no noticeable scratches, it is 100% unlocked, the only bad thing was The capacity of the battery came to me with 78% health, but I bought him a new battery and I already have a new cell phone, really super recommended. The camera is of good quality, the volume is excellent, the whole cell phone is perfect to be reconditioned, so far I have not had problems. Btw im latino so If you want to buy the cell phone for Latin America, if it will serve you because it is unlocked. (iphone gold 64 gb, all carriers, seller Hybrid IT, renewed)",4
327,"April 1, 2021. The cell phone has dirt in the joints, marks from a lot of use, it has a lot of wear and tear on the front and rear glass.I do not recommend it.Seller: buyspray",1
328,"I used the phone with AT&T for about nine months. It worked well. When I asked AT&T to unlock the phone so I could use it with another carrier, AT&T had no record of the phone I received from this seller. Thus, unless I use this phone is used only with AT&T, the phone is useless going forward.Phones advertised as AT&T carrier phones should fall under the general rules and conditions of what it means to have phones locked to that carrier. AT&T can unlock phones that are originally locked to them. Apparently, mine works with AT&T (described as ""partially unlocked"" by AT&T reps) but cannot be unlocked unless the original carrier is identified. This seller said it's AT&T AT&T says it's not AT&T.Should it really fall to me, the consumer, who believes ""Apple iPhone 8, 64GB, Gold - For AT&T"" means the phone is registered to AT&T -- to resolve this issue? A consumer can't unlock a phone. Only a carrier can.",1
329,"Purchased as a birthday gift, so didnt find out until after it was opened that the giftee couldnt even use it because it wasnt compatible. I specifically searched for an unlocked phone for that very reason. This was falsely advertised... now going through the trouble of returning it and waiting on a refund.",1
330,My daughter is unfortunately an iPhone girl through and through so we got this for her for graduation. It arrived on time and as described. It has worked well so far (we've had it for two days now) and my daughter loves it.,5
331,"Despite all being called 'iPhone 8' there are actually several models of iPhone 8 that exist. These are specific for either the GSM or CDMA networks, which are two different types of cellular technologies used by the major carriers (Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, ect). CDMA compatible phones do not work on GSM networks and vice versa. So it's a misnomer to say that any phone which is exclusively GSM or CDMA is ""Fully Unlocked""- because it will literally be incompatible on a hardware level with about have of the carriers. I was sent the A1905 model of the iPhone 8 (at the time of purchase there was no indication of what model was being sold- just ""Fully Unlocked"") and this particular model is incompatible with the Sprint network. The lack of nuance in the item listing speaks to incompetence in the people who put this item for sale.",1
332,"This is a better iPhone than the 7S and any before it and at same time it’s not a better phone than 8S or any that have come since.I think the renewed standard has set a high bar, one which was not met with my order. There is a visible scratch on the screen that can be seen at an arms reach. I’m not sending it back to wait phoneless for a new one, but I think it’s a valid complaint. One that is probably common in occurrence but not often acted upon.Otherwise the screen graphics and interface is really nice, the processor doesn’t leave me wanting, and all these things are known by almost all iPhone owners. My review is about Renewed, and the difficult standard set that may offer more than what this particular  supplier is able to provide.",4
333,It worked fine until a month ago when the speakers started going out on it. I could hear decently on speaker phone when calls were placed but now they’re not very loud at all and I have to hold the speaker to my ear. Couldn’t even last a year.,1
334,I love the phone but it was not 256G only 64G and I really wanted the phone for the storage. I could have gotten a cheaper phone by just getting the iPhone 6s that was advertised as 64G! I hate I didn’t get to save money since the phone is the exact phone I already had but I had already promised my little sister my old phone and didn’t want to make her wait by sending this one back for false advertising. Great quality and was boxed very professionally!,3
335,"Wholly unimpressed with Amazon's 'renewed' service.-- I bought a phone compatible with T-Mobile, but our sims wouldn't work. After an extended support call we found out the phone was locked to a carrier in Japan. It was suggested that I could call them to ask for the phone to be unlocked... yeah no thanks.-- Also: The phone just randomly shuts off. Mid-use, and the phone's screen is black and the button is unresponsive. Nice job at 'renewing'.So whatever 'renewed' means to Amazon, it is not ""refurbished, functioning phone"". Returning it and shopping elsewhere.",1
336,"i love that amazon (or whoever they sub this out to) gave a warranty, that was one of the main reasons i purchased.  Plus cost was cheaper than Best Buy.  Not sure if this has to do w the phone, but my email is slow to load.  I also dont like the fact that i cant plug normal headset in without adapter, but that is apples issue.  Overall the phone was a good decision to purchase and i have no problems.  ( I was forced to buy newer cause iphone 6 doesnt upgrade anymore to latest IOS)",4
337,Wouldn't get any service. And not very cooperative service,1
338,"First time I ever bought an iphone online instead of from the service provider.  Was easy to set up and sync with my other devices.  I am very pleased. It came with the charging cable and adapter.  The phone was in great condition, not ""beat up"" or scratched.  Would buy again.  I don't use face recognition so I cannot honestly rate that.",5
339,Got the device in and the charging port didn’t work. Jus save yourself the time n money n don’t do it. And it had a crack on the front screen,1
340,"Purchased “fully unlocked” iPhone 8 and it will not work with Sprint.  After entering the IMEI on multiple wireless carriers; only 2 worked with this “fully unlocked” cell phone.After contacting BREED who manages the sales of this phone - the response received was...“ Even if a phone is unlocked, we cannot guarantee that your service provider will accept it. ”So buyer beware if you buy a “fully unlocked” phone or won’t work on all carriers as advertised.  In the area the ad included all carriers including Sprint however that was not true!",1
341,"The iPhone 8 arrived within two days. Phone looks great like it’s brand new. It’s rose gold color. Received the phone yesterday and got wireless service for it today with AT&T. Nothing bad to say. There are many negative reviews on refurbished phones, but just do your homework and research before purchasing.",5
342,"The phone arrived in good condition, there is a small inner crack but I barely notice it, everything works well and for the price I am happy. It was easy enough to set up, I will update if anything changes. The battery charges fast, it was at 50% when it came and after 15 minutes of charging it was almost full. Looking forward to using this phone more!",4
343,"We purchased two of these phones. One arrived with an LCD bleed, which at least allowed us to see the problem early enough to send it back in time for a refund. Please note that the problem was clearly visible as soon as the phone was turned on. It should have never been resold this way. The second phone would occasionally not connect to cellular data, a problem that got worse over time until it eventually stopped making and receiving calls altogether.I cannot stress enough the frustration you will likely feel at buying a ""refurbished"" phone that has seemingly not undergone any refurbishing. I'm sure others have had better luck of the draw, but there doesn't seem to be any quality control on what's being sent out. It is a waste of money and time, and you are better off not purchasing here.",1
344,Horrible company. DO NOT BUY from this company. Bought a refurbished iPhone 8. Worked great for 5 months then internal chip went out and phone needs replaced. Emailed company and they said since it’s out of 3 month warranty they won’t do anything about it.  So now I have a $300 paper weight! Money is hard to come by and unless you have money to waste DO NOT buy from this company.  We need companies that will stand behind their products and this one will not do that!,1
345,"DONT BUY THIS! I am so disappointed!!! This phone keeps shutting off randomly, it won’t open apps consistently. PLEASE don’t but this.Also in the details of the product it’s advertised as a larger screen but it ended up being smaller. Unfortunately I was going abroad and could not return this product on time!!!!!",1
346,"Whenever my phone breaks, I usually buy a replacement from someone on craigslist - I thought this would be a safer bet. Unfortunately seems not to be the case. Probably won't buy from this source again. I've had it for just a few days. The first day I used it, it kept shutting down at 25% battery (1 app open). On day 2, the thumbprint recognition stopped working. The edges of the screen are also flickering, but it's possibly its some kind of weird refraction thing happening through the glass protector sheet.",3
347,"I was nervous (due to reviews) after having already ordered an Unlocked iPhone 8 (256GB), but I knew that Amazon is excellent with fixing problems, and this particular seller's products are guaranteed by Amazon Renewed program. This phone came in excellent condition, in my opinion. The battery is at around 90% capacity, there are few, if any, cosmetic conditions, and most importantly, the iPhone was truly unlocked. I was able to get up and running in minutes by simply moving my SIM card over to the new phone and going through new iPhone setup. I have Verizon, by the way. Not that it should matter. If it works as unlocked on one carrier, it should work for any others.*I have not reviewed ""facial recognition"" due to the fact that I have not set it up.",5
348,Unable to activate with T-Mobile like advertised. Tried over the phone with Tmobile and at the tmobile store with new sim card both new cards always said invalid sim card. Should have listened to the crappy reviews. Amazon Renew service is a joke.,1
349,"I bought this phone, got it all setup, everything was good...until Verizon suspended my phone number because the Iphone 8 I purchased on Amazon was marked as fraudulent/stolen.  Returned right away but customer service didn't seem too bothered by the fact that it was a fraudulent item.",1
350,"Box was not sealed.  When I opened the Amazon box, the phone was not protected and was loose rolling around in the Amazon box.  The white box the phone should have been in was opened up with all parts not secured.  Also, the plug and cable shipped are 3rd party junk that did not work.",1
351,"My daughter’s renewed phone had weirdly washed out colors with a blue tint to the screen. Found out that cheap third party after-market screen replacements are (unsurprisingly) not nearly as good Apple’s original screens, and you can find out which yours is if under Display & Brightness there’s a toggle for True Tone. Sure enough, no True Tone option on her new phone. My eyes are too used to the vibrant screens to be comfortable with the weird ones, but they accepted my return without problem. Bought a renewed one from a different company on Amazon, and this one had True Tone. If this is something that’s going to bother you, beware. Photo: phone on the left is True Tone, phone on the right is the renewed one we returned.",3
352,"Apple products are expensive.  Many people cannot wait to upgrade...our family just waits for people to do just that and for companies to refurbish perfectly good phones.  This one came in less than 6 days, all functions working properly, just as advertised was unlocked, bluetooth transfer of data in less than 30 minutes.  The only slightly negative comment is that the refurbished phone came with generic charger and not Apple products.  No ear bud jack in this phone, so remember to get wireless earbuds.",5
353,"I bought my iPhone 8 from Hybrid IT because of their ratings. When I found a small issue with the screen, they replied to my message within hours and I had a replacement unit in just a few days.The new unit is perfect. I would believe it was brand new right out of the factory package. Even the battery health is 100%.I highly recommend buying from Hybrid IT.",5
354,"I was really hoping to get a decent working phone for me and my other half and thought to look on Amazon since I get pretty much everything from here. Both phones arrived in a cardboard box with a charger and a pamphlet of information. Both phones looked to be in good condition but when looking closer you can see scratches and smalls dings; not a total issue since I also purchased cell phone cases. The major issues came into play when using the devices. I can only talk on my phone (gold iphone 8) when it’s on speaker or the person on the other end cannot hear or it’s jumbled (every call). My other half’s phone (red iphone 8) will randomly drop or end calls, no matter how reception is or if connected to wifi. We’ve waited to see if it would possibly go away after software updates and Nothing!",1
355,"I received my two phones in two days a stated with amazon prime. Phone looked really good to be refurbished. Normal scratches not too noticeable nothing too bad cosmetics wise. Came with a charger and block piece; comes inside small amazon boxes wrapped in bubble wrap for extra protection. I had no problem logging into my iCloud. I switched carriers from sprint to metro which was the reason for purchase. CDMA and GSM are completely different. The phones worked just fine . The IMEI was clear and was not on the blacklist. SIM cards were activated and put in and within 45 I had new service with these phones. I did take them to the store and let the rep put in the SIM cards. Though only been active for 24 hours on these phones. No complaint so far only that the battery does not hold a charge like a newer phone might . So keep a charger near, especially if you use your phone a lot during the day. Overall I’ll say 4.5/5 I’m very satisfied for the price I paid.",5
356,"It's definitely ""buyer beware"" when buying a ""renewed"" iPhone from Verizon -- because Verizon's iPhones are not truly renewed.  The last two that I have purchased from Verizon have had their battery health levels fall below 80 within three (3) weeks, and two (2) months, respectively.  One of the two displayed a ""battery significantly degraded"" message.  What a waste of my time and Amazon's refund, shipping, and return expenses.  Suggestion for Verizon:  why don't you focus your efforts on selling iPhones that have acceptable levels of battery health?  #NeverAgainfromVerizon",1
357,"It was assessed that the microphones were cut when the back plate of the phone was replaced during its refurbishment. Another $70 plus lost time for phone not working, appointments, waiting on parts, and installation. Frustrating.",5
358,"Phone unable to read SIM card. Returning for refund.  It is Saturday & I am unable to connect with the seller until Monday.In processing the return I learned in the Instructions #1 “All returns are subject to 15% restocking fee.”#2 that “Shipping charges are not refundable, only the purchase price is refundable minus restocking fee.  Customer remains responsible for the shipping and handling expenses of all returns.”This is totally unacceptable. I expect a total refund for a Defective product including the warranty that I purchased.I was unable to review any other features, as the phone never worked.",1
359,"It was delivered on time, all good, without any complaints. The only detail is a scratch on the top of the phone. The iphone was delivered with a maximum battery capacity of 87%. It is fully unlocked",4
360,"Sadly they had sent a phone that was defective and would shut down randomly, with research I found this was a hardware problem in some IPhones. I wish they would have done more extensive testing on their products before shipping to customers. They provided a full refund in a timely manner which was nice.",2
361,"I ordered this phone on December 20th and it was expected to come on the 31st. To my surprise it came just two days after on December 23rd without Amazon Prime. As for the phone itself, it worked well and looked new from afar. I think there were some minor scuffs but nothing a phone case can't hide. The phone itself came with a charger though it wasn't an official apple one, still I appreciate that there was a charger. The only negative thing was that my phone is a Japanese phone so when I take photos even with the phone on silent, it still makes a shutter noise. It is an unlocked phone so take it to your provider so they can insert your sim card into it, it is a very simple process. Overall a great phone, if you can't afford to buy a new iPhone from the store, buy this one instead! I am very happy with my purchase.",5
362,"I realize this is a renewed phone, but I didn't expect the battery to be left at such a low charge level.  I wonder how long it's been sitting at that level?  The phone looks very nice with no scratches.  I'll charge it overnight and turn it on in the morning.  If there's more to tell I'll come back and edit this review.",4
363,"You won't be saving any money with these products. I purchased 2 and one had a faulty speaker that I cannot hear anyone when calling unless I turn on the loud speaker and the other phone dies within an hour of being unplugged. If I could rate 0 stars I would. Nothing ""refurbished"" about this. Same junk battery same junk speaker.",1
364,"The phone arrived as expected and looked good.  Battery was at 80% health as was advertised online.  However; be aware that 80% must be the Service cut off for Apple.  When we checked the battery health in settings, it reports that the batter needs to be serviced.  As a comparison... I have another Iphone 8 with battery health at 88% and the Iphone 6s that we were replacing has batter health of 84%.  I was not expecting to have to pay another 70+ dollars to replace the battery on this phone.Update:  We also found out a few days after we received the phone that the front facing camera does not work.At this point, I would not recommend this seller to anyone.  Their Quality Control is not very good.",1
365,I am so so thankful I went with my gut and bought this phone! I'm in love!! I received it in perfect condition. Not one scratch and battery life was at 80%. There was the standard charger with it as well. I immediately went to Metro where I paid $17 and spent about 10 minutes transferring the phone onto my account. Everything went seamlessly! The phone works amazing!! There's not been one issue with it. I would buy this again and again.,5
366,Battery isn't working properly. It drains for no reason even when not in use. I haven't had it for long. its a poorly thought out system you cant get a replacement until they recive the device which will leave you without access to a cellphone if its your only phone. I wasn't expecting a new phone but i was expecting it to function normally so definitely turnes out to be a disappointment.,1
367,"No headphones, the plug has different color of the cable and not original it was cut after three days.",1
368,This iPhone 8 arrived with no imperfections I could find. Battery health is barely over 80 but it was advertised to be over 80 and it is. It is unlocked but is is an a1906 model which was to be sold in  Japan. It does seem to work here in the US though. I’ll use it and see if anything comes up. Do far I’m  satisfied.,5
369,"Great product. Switching from an Android, had to get used to. Battery comes as an 80%. So I purchased a new high capacity battery from this website. Costs about $22.00 . Installed it, and waiting to put the first charge to it.",5
370,"Adorable little phone I got for my daughter. She went from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone 8, not really for any sort of “upgrade”, but because her 7 shut off on her and would not turn back on. This phone arrived in MINT condition and let me clarify when I say MINT. Screen was untouched, not one dent or scratch in the entire body of the phone, this phone was BRAND NEW. Unlocked, reset, ready to go. My daughter couldn’t believe it when she received her phone, she absolutely loves it. Highly recommend this seller for true-to-his word details and description. This kinda stuff doesn’t happen to me. We are satisfied 100%.",5
371,So embarrassing. I bought this phone for my daughter's birthday and it turn on for few minutes and then shut off and never came back on.end up buying a new one for just $150 dollars more( with all the warranties).and i had to pay for the return.,1
372,"The problem with this phone was the screen kept getting dark. I called Apple  tech service who after troubleshooting said it was a light sensor issue, so back it went. Customer service with Hybrid IT was VERY GOOD  though, that's why I gave it 3 stars.",3
373,After requesting a refund because the phone literally fell apart they said they would refund my money when they received the phone. Upon receipt they refused my refund because the phone was apart😳. Amazon refunded my money. DO NOT TRUST THIS VENDER. A repair shop told me it was missing various parts that actually held the phone together. I had the phone 2 weeks before it fell apart. Their guarantee says 90 days. It’s a great guarantee if nothing goes wrong with the phone😡,1
374,The phone came in excellent condition. Worked until I updated it and now I cannot use it with my cellular data. Apple quoted me $360 to fix it. I’m very disappointed in the short length of time the phone actually worked but it is not the sellers fault.,2
375,The phone works amazing. The battery life only came at 80% which I am kind of bummed about. But the thing that really Bugs me is the back camera won’t focus. I looked it up and tried all the methods of fixing it. Updating did nothing and can’t get it to focus.,3
376,The I phone was defective and did not receive a Sim card and therefore we are sending it back to the seller!,1
377,"I ordered this iPhone on 2 Apr 21.  I came back to Kenya on 18 April 21, like an idiot I thought the seller advertised the product honestly and I could depend on it.  Since I am in Kenya I know they will not honor a warranty.  I already had to  replace the battery and the charging port at a cost of $90.00.  The phone developed an issue and started burning the tips on the charging cables at the rate of one a week and these cost $25 to $30 each here.  Now the screen has started to crack, no I have not dropped it, first the piece at the bottom by the home button came off then it started to peel away around the home button then it cracked on the sides.  I am now a believer, I will not purchase a ""refurbished"" phone again.",1
378,"I was so happy to receive my phone today... only to find out the speaker is really low. I have to put it on speaker phone in order to hear the person I'm talking to. Also, it does really quickly. I charged it to 100% before using it and before I could finish downloading apps it was on 56% in less than an hour.***Few days later*** I had considered keeping this phone to give my child as a birthday gift until today I decided to remove the screen cover thinking it would help with the Touch button and as far as hearing only to notice that there are scratches on the phone screen itself. Never purchasing from this seller again.",1
379,Battery was down to 83%. Fingerprint scanner is hit and miss.Still a good value.,5
380,"I don’t write reviews but I do read them to make my decision.I had a sub of mine but me Two gold 64gb iPhone 8’s unlocked.They are currently running on metro by T-Mobile, all I had to do was call in and give them my IMEIs.I almost didn’t buy them because of some negative reviews but I’m very glad I did.I downgraded from an XS so I’m not 100% satisfied, but I do love my iPhone 8’s.It’s been almost 3 mo this since having them and they work perfectly. No flaws. 98% battery health. Almost brand new iPhone. Came with two original Apple chargers no headphones.Generic box not iPhone box.",5
381,"Yep. No complaints here. The phone performed as advertised right out the box. A year later, it's still performing very well.  Pleasant surprise, especially when we're talking about refub iPhones, right?",5
382,Sold under Amazon Renewed by Olympus the screen was defective.  Amazon would do nothing to help and Olympus only offered to refund the product at my shipping expense.  So there is no Amazon Renewed Guarantee other than you can get a refund.  Spend hours with customer service with no resolution.Update:  The seller now has offered to pay return shipping after brining it to their attention therefore I have improved the rating.,3
383,"Was extremely happy with the phone out of the box.  No damage to it whatsoever. I live in Poland but bought it when back in the States for vacation.  Was acting weird with my Polish sim card in the US but chalked this up to the fact I was in a different country than my sim card.  Got back to Poland, and problems continued.  85% of the time I have no service (phone or internet), even though I have an unlimited plan.  Even when in a safe wifi area, I have no service.  Basically, I'm without a phone if I don't have wifi to use whatsapp or messenger.  Phone is useless.  Very disappointed.",1
384,Verizon refurbished phone indistinguishable from new. Setup was easy and price is great for 256gb,5
385,"The phone was in good condition and my son was pleased with it until the battery died less than six months after receiving it. The seller said it was a cheap fix, only $12.00, but if that were the case, why didn’t he put a new battery in it before he sold it to me? It cost my son $60.00. Very disappointed.",3
386,"The item description said something like 'looks like new if held at arm's length'. The phone looks like new even when looked at from the closest distance. Shipping was way faster than advertised. And the battery is at 96% maximum capacity - great stuff! I am super happy with this seller, thank you very much!",5
387,"The phone looks perfect, and I bought an unlocked version and it worked perfectly with my Verizon network. Came with an aftermarket charger, But quite honestly it’ll probably last longer than an Apple charger. As long as the phone holds up this review will stay good. If it craps out I will come back and update.",5
388,Phone arrived physically in good condition. Unfortunately it was NOT FULLY UNLOCKED as described. Despite contacting the seller they did not acknowledge the problem and eventually had to go with a return. They still sent me an email telling me that I need to return to them an unlocked phone had I received an unlocked phone I would not need to return it. I would not recommend this seller at all.,1
389,"Ask the seller about the battery life! I received a phone with a pretty low one. It was okay since I just ordered this to trade in for a different device, but still surprised how low the battery health was for the phone.Also if you're also ordering to trade in, you can contact the seller and they will send you the IMEI number so you can start the trade in process instead of waiting for the phone to arrive first.",4
390,As expectedFast shippingLike new,5
391,"I been having this phone for a couple of months now, I bought it right before going away for training, the speaker 🔈 is broken. I sent an email to the sender hoping to get a replacement before leaving, unfortunately they refused until They received the defective item back. That was impossible for me, since I didn’t have a replacement. They always want their money upfront, regardless of how they send their items out, which is not fair!!",3
392,UPDATE I ordered the same phone from HYBRID IT which ive bought from before so I knew this would be better. Of course it was the best experience! HYBRID IT IS THE BEST RENWED SELLER TO WORK WITH!!!Previous post for loop mobile-I learned my lesson. Only buy refurb products from a reputable third party on amazon renewed! The phone came with a passcode so I had to send it back. I ordered this same phone from a previous seller I trust from Amazon and of course it came Passcode free like a new phone would be. Loop mobile please do better!,5
393,A bit disappointed in the battery health condition of the phone. It’s almost time to change the battery on this phone. How can this be certified refurbished and ship with a questionable battery.3/2/2020 Update:  Have contacted seller twice about battery issue. No response. So far.  Have dropped review to 1 star.  Will keep you updated.,1
394,"Seller-  Hybrid ITBattery Life  85%No cosmetic imperfections of any kindTouch screen and camera  as newall buttons (volume , power and silent) clean and responsive as new.This is the best refurbished set i have ever bought.Hats off for the seller for maintaining mint condition inventory",5
395,"Camera came with scratches on the case and screen. Battery was at 88% max health. Camera did not work. Broken junk, PITA to set up and then have to delete and send back because this company could do a basic test of the device before reselling it.",1
396,"First time purchasing a used phone. After charging to 96% (highest it will charge), the phone was turned off for the day. When turned back on, the power went to 25%. The battery simply won’t hold a charge. No apps were added, no photos taken. In fact, I deleted apps that were not necessary.",4
397,"I don't like to buy any kind of device online because you're never too sure about what you're getting. But overall I would highly recommend. Only downside is I was at least expecting 90% battery life, but then that's my fault because I didn't read everything on the sellers page. One of the speakers also isnt working. Then after a day of using the device I stumbled upon a problem that was inconvenient, the app store wasn't downloading apps. After being on the phone with apple care for over an hour they couldn't help me with the problem. I ended up factory resetting the phone. It came with a charger and the block. I took my risk and I'm not disappointed.",4
398,"I was nervous at first but it was literally the easiest purchase for such a in demand product. I bought the iPhone 8 for my son for the holiday and worried there’d be a SIM card issue, NOPE! The phone was in perfect condition and we stopped by the nearest MetroPCS and he’s been eat to ear smiles. Thank you for making this holiday a smooth one. I may be buying myself one as well ;)",5
399,I could not be happier with this purchase. My phone looks and functions like brand new. I’m so glad I decided to go this route instead of paying over double for a new phone.,5
400,"Purchased this for my son who lost his phone. The phone is exactly as described. Had some minor cosmetic imperfections (I was expecting them so no shock), and it works flawlessly (we’ve had it several months now, and no problems). My only complaint was that the shipping took longer (by about 1 week) than was originally estimated when I ordered it.Other than the shipping time being a little long, I’m very pleased.",5
401,"This is the second iPhone I purchased from this purveyor within the past 6 months. First was iPhone 7. They accepted the return. The next is iPhone 8.  Each of the phones have failed due to error Update is required to use cellular data. Can’t make calls. The 8 was fixed once but now I am having that issue, and it appears it cannot be fixed this time. Obviously this company is selling faulty refurbished phones.Update, the above phone was able to be restarted. But, once again the phone has failed for the same reason. I’ll be paying Best Buy another visit. Hopefully they can work some magic and get it working again like first time, but they could not two days ago. Not optimistic.",1
402,"This is the best! My son loved it he was so happy about it! There is no scratches, No dents no nothing. It doesn't look refurbished it looks bran new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to buy a phone. Doesn't come with original charger cube but not really affecting how it charges. It charges really fast and runs out really slowly. Price is astonishing.",5
403,The phone arrived with only 10% battery charged.  I plug in to wall charger and began transferring data from my android.  12 hrs later phone still not charged.  Contact customer service - ordered new charger - 12 hrs later phone still not charging at all and is now completely dead!  Contact customer service - phone broken pls return - unable to send replacement phone. Oh...and by the way - all data must be deleted before you return it or you will not be refunded your $400!!!,1
404,"As expected, the battery was not at 100% capacity but it was higher than expected at 89%.There’s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order.I did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did! The screen protector was already in place so I didn’t have to use the one I bought and I will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case I need it later.This was listed as a FULLY UNLOCKED iPhone and I believe it has arrived as such, it will definitely work for the carrier I initially intended, which is Cricket.I believe my little sister has a step up from this phone (the 8 Plus) and she’s still paying for her phone through the provider. I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so I’m glad it worked out, if anything happens within the next 90 days before the Amazon warranty expires I’ll be sure to update. Definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone, as accidents do happen.",5
405,"wow. i was pretty skeptical and nervous about buying this from the reviews. the box seemed a bit damaged like someone had tried to open it but nonetheless, i opened the box, set up the phone, and it works perfectly! i LOVE this phone! do not hesitate to buy! it is unlocked, no scratches or damage at all. i did not expect this phone to be in such great condition, knowing that it was used. you won’t regret it!",5
406,"Bought this to replace my old iPhone 8 that was the exact same specs. I do feel like the battery life is lasting longer on the new replacement versus my old one! It did come with a charger (not apple but it's fine) and sim popper. My new phone is working just fine, have not had any complaints !",5
407,"I purchased a fully unlocked (renewed) device and the phone was indeed not fully unlocked. Shipping was fast and the cosmetic condition was also as described. I have no complaints there. However, the device is void/null if it's not unlocked and thus, not compatible with my carrier. It was extremely disappointing as the description states that the device passed all diagnostic tests and was certified as being fully unlocked. This is MAJOR false advertising in my opinion. Still waiting to see how the returns process will go with the seller - I will update this review if it goes smoothly.",1
408,"These are not “arm length” good as advertised. I hardly count a chip in the expensive back glass as acceptable. Ordered another one and due to weather it’s been stuck in transit for a week now. Hopefully the next one arrives unharmed and here before the 28th, otherwise I’m returning both.",2
409,I've bought from this seller before and been extremely pleased with their products.  Will always look to buy from them in the future.,5
410,"I was in the market for a renewed iPhone 8 256gb and a friend suggested I purchase from BuySPRY based on their experience. Honestly, I'm not sure why BuySPRY has only an 85% seller rating over the past 12 months. The iPhone 8 256gb I received is in like new condition. After restoring the phone from my iCloud backup, I immediately went to the battery in settings and was very pleased to find battery health of 99%. Very pleased. I will update this review if anything goes wrong within the 90 day amazon return period.",5
411,"I was having some trouble with the sound fading out and I was going to return the phone just 2 days before the deadline to return would be up, and the seller immediately provided me with a postage paid return label.  Then I spent hours on the phone with Comcast and Apple and it was determined that the problem was not with the phone but with the cell phone service.  (I had started having the same problem with my Android phone as I have 2 phones.) It is a long story but before I bought this phone I bought the same phone from the same seller because I had tried to cancel it because I had failed to get the 0% financing and failed so I returned it ad ordered it again.  had received my refund right away.  So I am happy with the phone and with the seller, BuySPRY.",5
412,"This phone is in perfect condition, just like a brand new phone but for a better price. Absolutely no issues and works with cricket.",5
413,"I’ve had the phone less than 2 weeks.  The camera goes blurry when trying to take a picture.  Also, the battery barely holds a charge.  I’m very disappointed.  I took a chance, bought a refurbished phone instead of a new one, and 2 weeks later I am retuning it because it is defective.",2
414,Unfortunately the one came in the box did not charge at all. We had to return it. Guess it happens when you buy an iPhone online.,1
415,"Great phone AND great support from QD Electronics.  I received the cell phone a day ahead of schedule and from all appearances it looked great.  I did have one issue, but it was quickly resolved by QD Electronics to my satisfaction and I have rigorously tested the phone over the past 24 hours looking for issues but finding NONE.  I would definitely buy the ""renewed"" phone again and would definitely use QD Electronics.",5
416,"I ordered this phone fully unlocked in a desperate attempt to get a quick replacement for the one I dropped in a toilet.  After purchasing, I read the comments thoroughly and thought the phone would not be compatible with my Boostmobile network.  I even contacted the seller to alert them to my potential return.  When it arrived, I immediately took it to Boostmoble to see if it would work.  It was a success.  However I had to pay $35. Bucks.  My iPhone 6 memory card is not compatible with the iphone8.  I had to buy a compatible boostmobile SIM card.  I love my new phone.  Great quality.",5
417,"This phone looks perfect and new and it arrived overnight with Prime shipping (in NY).  I transferred SIM cards from my old Verizon iphone 8 to this one, and this new beauty was up and working in 10 minutes.  Came in a plain box, with an off-name ""c"" charger and I have not tested the battery life yet.  To this point, however, I'm thrilled.",5
418,"My 16yr old son needed a new phone and every store we went to was literally out of iPhones, sooo I checked on amazon and found a refurbished iPhone he actually liked for a decent price. I was really worried until the package arrived and we opened it up ... he’s had this phone for almost two weeks now and it has been great! I am so happy I decided to purchase this iPhone. Will be purchasing in the future.",5
419,Not happy about receiving a locked phone. We have tried to reach out to the seller but they have not communicated with a solution to the problem. We are very disappointed.,1
420,"The phone arrived with a small scratch in the top corner of the screen,but hard to see at first glance. We had no issues connecting the phone to our carrier, and functionally the phone is doing good so far. Also the battery health was at 94%. I was skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised.",4
421,"Don’t be discouraged if it comes in a Verizon box! I was and I have Metro PCS. Phone is unlocked and ready to use when you get it! Barely any wear on the phone and I only noticed a tiny scratch around my camera. That is is. The graphics are amazing, the sound quality is impeccable. Definitely recommend this phone! Only downside is no aux port! But still has the button unlike the IPhone X series!",5
422,"I am very pleased with the quality of the phone I received.  The renewed premium quality is true to its description; my iPhone arrived with no cosmetic damage visible at all, not even when the device is scrutinized.  Battery health upon deliver was 99%!  The battery charge level upon arrival was 50%, indicating that care was taken with the handling of this device.  Device was packaged with care. All microphones, cameras and speakers operate with no flaws at all.  Additionally, the iPhone arrived very clean, with no debris or lint in the charging port or speaker areas.  Grills over mics/speakers were clean and perfectly intact as well.  I could not be more pleased with this product.",5
423,"Received the phone and it would randomly turn off for hours on end and wouldn’t turn back on despite a full charge. Returned the product and the seller refunded only half what I paid for a broken phone. I’ve contacted them, but have yet to hear back.",1
424,Phone looks and works like a new phone. My only complaint is the battery  health came at 84%. Apple recommends battery replacement at 79%.  These refurbish companies should simply install new batteries and charge $20 more than it would be a 5 star deal and be a as new phone.,4
425,"I will never buy a phone from Amazon again. This is the upgraded refurbished phone you’d think it would have been fine or at least the support would’ve been good but the whole experience was terrible. As soon as it arrived the camera kept freezing on me then stopped working all together. Getting support was a joke. I spent over an hour total with two different support people walking me through every solution they could think of. Press this button, hold the sleep button, now try this and that and 100 other things. What a waste of time! I gave up and said can you send me a replacement and they never even acknowledge it just kept going with this and that to get it to work. I finally just submitted a return. What a headache!!",1
426,"Second try for an Amazon refurbished iPhone. ( different vendor )One month report all good. Battery health, AT&T carrier service, overall function without any problem. Cosmetically  perfect Purchased from Hybrid IT via Amazon . First try (different vendor) for an Amazon refurb iPhone resulted in a no hassle, immediate refund.",5
427,I got this phone and one other for my parents for Christmas. This one worked well and has good battery life for my dad who does spend a bit of time playing games. I do not believe this phone offers facial recognition but the fingerprint reader works like a new phone. Happy with this one. The other was not holding a charge for more than a few hours so the vendor accepted the return and gave a quick full refund.,4
428,The phone itself is fine. My issue is the fact that it was advertised as being unlocked for Verizon. It doesn't have signal. Take the sim card out and put it in another phone any other phone... 4 bars. It's about as useful as a tiny tablet when connected to wifi and a brick when not connected to wifi,1
429,"At this time in writing, both devices are useless the first refrebished phone is over heating everytime the user tries to use Facetime or phone calls.The second phone is currently not even turning back on, it just blacked out and currently isn't taking charge.I don't recommend purchasing refrebished phones from this vendor as they are not functioning as intended.",1
430,"We ordered from Kiss Electronics, and maybe we were one of the lucky ones but the phone was in perfect physical condition -- no scratches, scuffs, or other sign of wear.  Brand new tempered glass screen protector applied.  Came with a white charger from a ZTE phone (it works) and a generic lightning cable.  Battery health is at 89%, not great but not bad either for a used phone.",5
431,At first I wasn’t sure what I was going to get I had a 6s for a long time and didn’t want to get into a contract to get a new phone getting a used from from amazon has worked great it’s just like getting a new one but not having to pay the price tag. Not a scratch on it works great and came with a wall charger and cord,5
432,Phone has average battery life and price was about average.  Phone was in good working order when received. However needed to replace screen recently. No visible damage was present but display stopped working. Not sure if there was warranty on this purchase but couldn't needed to have repaired quickly so I didn't have time to find out.,3
433,Did not work on arrival. 3 stars is for the customer service that processed the return with no issues. Ended up buying new...,3
434,"Really nice... It seems a brand new iPhone 8, out of the box.  At first, I wasn't sure whether I should buy or not because of there are a lot of negative reviews for this particular phone along with its seller (vendor).  Thus far, I have no issue with the iPhone 8.  Of course, all consumers would be so cautious when he/she is looking for a refurbished/used phone.  If I were to pick one minor thing that this phone should have is that ""No place for an ear-pieces.""  Other than this particular one is missing, I would highly recommend to others to consider if you're looking for a refurbished iPhone.",5
435,"Phone shipped a day sooner than scheduled. When I took it out of the box, I thought it was brand new. I charged it up and set it next to my old iPhone 7 and everything auto transferred, updates processed and the phone works flawlessly. I’m so impressed, and I was worried about buying a used phone. Battery is well over 85%. Great purchase so far. It came with a 90 day warranty. If any issues develop I’ll report with an updated review, but I anticipate all will be good.",5
436,"The phone came in amazing condition and literally looked brand new. Aside from the packaging, you would have thought it was a brand new iPhone. The battery life was 90%... fantastic for a used/renewed device. I am quite happy and would purchase from here again.",5
437,"For 300 this is a great deal. Only problem is this is a Japanese model and should be advertised as such. One, and very annoying difference is the stupid camera sound is forced on no matter what. All those perverts over there in Japan need to calm down. Besides that, the phone is of above average condition with a few minor blemishes, but that’s to be expected at this price. Battery is at 92%",4
438,"I was most disappointed.  They left an iPhone on my front porch!  My husband was home.  No phone or ring!  It was little enough to go in our locked mail box!  Or require a signature, or ring the bell!  Something!!  It was inboxed!  No Apple charging cord or plug!  The screen ha many little scratches and is cloudy!  Won’t but from this complaint again.  The reviews were good so I felt confident with my purchase.",3
439,"Very happy, only had it for a week but I was very impressed by the quality, honestly, came in a brand new condition, no scratches, bumps, nothing! Everything has worked like it is supposed to and YES I was able to easily change SIM cards and it worked fine. Very please, so much that I am already ordering my second one, hope that it comes in “like new” condition as well!",5
440,"I had a good experience,i man i know people complain about battery issues but if i am correct Apple took responsibility for this.  But with my phone no issues as far as i can tell, it was used so i expected a bit of bang up but i had a decent experience i would say.",5
441,"Had to replace my moms iPhone 4SE, and I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews. It shipped very quickly and it showed up very well packed. Opened and gotta say It looks brand new. Not a scratch or dent. Came with like a 10ft charging cable. Put the verizon sim in and Bam set it up. Was easy, no issue at all. My mom loves it and would definitely would buy again.",5
442,"The camera does not work.When I realized the camera was not working, the return window was almost closed. Since I had no intention to return it, I sent a message to the seller so we could try to fix it in time, but I had no answer. Now I realize how important the phone camera is these days, and I'm stock with a phone with a defective camera. I regret buying it.",1
443,"Product was cosmetically great and functional. The downside was the battery life. I bought this for my son and he told me the battery dies much faster than his last iPhone. I had to purchase a newer battery and install it, now it’s much better and my son is happy.",3
444,"The reviews made this seem more like a roulette thing since the iPhone that I bought here works as expected, light scratches to the screen, not that many scratches in the back which is good. Fingerprint reader works great, very fast. Both cameras work great too. The charger that came with the phone along with other cheap ones though don’t work at all, I have to use a really good quality one and it solved my problem. Overall I highly recommend to buy this product if you press your luck.",5
445,"Phone arrived in good condition and was functional. However, it was a crock! The phone could not be activated by t-mobile. The previous owner never paid it off and it was locked out of t-mobiles system. Requested a return so we’ll see if they refund me or not....",1
446,It’s fully functional and works just fine. I use straight talk and I haven’t really had any problems except at some point when I took calls I couldn’t hear them unless I put it on speaker but it went away and work just fine. Came with a tiny scratch on the bottom corner but I have a case on so I don’t see it. Same size as an iPhone 6 but the iPhone 6 has a louder earphone. I can hear through it but it’s not loud so that sucks but my phone works and it’s really nice. Came with a charger too. No earbuds unfortunately,4
447,"Phone didn’t look are work like new, and the battery life is terrible. Contacted the seller and he would not work with me on a return label. I had to contact Amazon about the issue. I would not recommend buying from this seller!",1
448,Purchase a refurb from them it was completely crap. First thing I notice camera horrible scratched. Phone than wouldn’t turn on for an hour why on the charger. When I finally got on the home button worked intermittently and than finally straw was the phone wouldn’t keep charging. Would charge some than I have fake play for a while for charge again. Only got to charge to 59%,1
449,Lovely iPhone 8 not a scratch or dent.  But  battery was completely dead and would not charge.  I tried 2 OEM chargers and the after market charger.  iphone would not start without charger cable attached.  Must return.,1
450,"I’m not sure what the iPhone 8, US version is, as I currently own the iPhone 8 as well, however this was much smaller than the one I currently own. It’s more of the SE edition, not even sure if I received the correct phone. Other than that I just gave that phone away to a family member so I’m not sure how they feel about it.",3
451,needed a new charger bcuz it didnt belong to phone but seller sent me one asap...did have a while on the phone with tmobile to clean phone to factory reset  then it work great looks brand new  no scratches  slick looking red phone  yes pick the red!! lol  definitely a great deal  thank you seller,5
452,Battery life was not as advertised. Also has many small imperfections that are visible at arms length. Customer service line they send with the item doesn’t answer and no one calls back. Very unhappy.,1
453,Purchased two iPhones to turn into AT&T to take advantage of their $700 credit towards and iPhone 12. Both phones came in excellent condition with chargers included.,5
454,"Battery is draining very quickly, need to charge multiple times in a day. Am a big fan of iphone and have been using iphones since 2008 but this phone sucks...This is the first time am giving a review for any Amazon products. NOT HAPPY ....calls disconnects while you are talking and it only connects back when u completely switch off and dial back in ... A BIG NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....",2
455,"Not going to lie I was very hesitant at first about making a purchase based on the reviews but... I decided to give it a try. I purchased this and arrived on date that was specified. Came completely protected in the packaging. Phone is refurbished. But everything looked fine with the phone. I turned it on and it was unlocked ready to use. It came with it's charger, except earphones. I'm sure my mom will love this phone for her birthday gift!",5
456,BEWARE !!!!!!!I give this phone a 1 star because the phones are NOT FULLY UNLOCKED or CARRIER UNLOCKEDI bought 2 of the iPhones 8 for my childrenAs these phones for Christmas presents  and tried to get them activated  to Xfinity (which is with Verizon)  I was told that the IMEI are locked so hopefully Amazon will refund me and take these WiFi only phones back !! I have called the third party seller but as of yet I haven’t not received any respondence ...,1
457,"There is a problem with the camera in addition to the scratches in the backThis phone has a defect in the camera and I had prepared the parcel to return the phone, but unfortunately, the Express asked for an exorbitant amount of freight to recharge, which would result in a great loss for me, and this is a picture of the camera clip from the phone that shows the defect, the shivering and vibration that clearly shows and reduces the efficiency of the phoneThe device has a malfunction in the camera, and unfortunately it was not according to the specifications announced by the seller, so it was a disappointing experience",1
458,Great phone for your money hands down. But kinda regret it Bc it was a gift for a girl I was talking to and now she is with someone else. At a least I know the block button still works on the phone,5
459,"Had multiple problems, the seller took it back and promptly refunded my money.",1
460,Unfortunately the battery does not last and had to return. Never bought renewed products now I know why.,2
461,Very disappointed after a day I started to realize the battery was draining in less then 30 mins I tryed to contact them but they wanted me to send back phone before a new one could get sent out I can't be out of phone due to work so I couldn't waste of money,1
462,I do not recommend purchasing from this seller. Products are refurbish. In Few weeks product started not functioning. Ask for exchange but refused to exchange took half of $$ for restocking fee?  Very poor customer service. Hope people going read reviews,1
463,The phone works fine except for the call volume. I can hear fine when the call is on speaker but not when I hold the phone to my ear.  I would think that would be tested on a refirbed phone. The company has offered to replace the phone but I would have to return this one 1st and be without a phone while I wait.,1
464,"This phone works great! We use it on the Mint Sim network ($15 a month for unlimited talk, text, and data) which is linked through Sprint. It was unlocked. It was in great shape and takes great pictures. Battery life is as it should be and we have had no problems at all with it since we bought it 7 months ago.",5
465,"I needed an upgrade from my old phone. It was an iPhone 6, and the home button didn't work, and the battery life was terrible. This phone was like new! No scratches or cracks, and it works flawlessly. Came fully unlocked like advertised, and all buttons all worked perfectly.",5
466,"I got a nearly brand new phone! It is definitely 100% worth the upgrade from the 6s, nearly everything about the phone is better. It didn’t come with the headphones or a headphone jack adapter though, so make sure you get that too. This was an incredible deal being as the iPhone 8 goes for twice the price from apple.",5
467,"Phone is in excellent condition (even came with a screen protector already attached).Only went to an iPhone (and away from Android) because of DarkSky being sold to Apple.This iPhone 8 with 256GB seemed like a decent buy at a reasonable cost. Popped the T-Mobile SIM card into this phone, and it worked right away.Came with a wall-adapter and USB cable.Nice phone in great condition!",5
468,"Loved the RED, Hated low battery life (Apple recommends replacement @ 80% approx. $80 fee) No ear phones ($26 @ Walmart) I'm having problems with the finger print recongination feature. Fat fingers, poor reader abilites, I'll have to return the phone if my teck. can't fix this. PHONE RETURNED",2
469,"This phone is spotless. Just received it today & tested all the features, everything is in good working condition and DOES work with verizon. Love it! Also, other reviews stated it was a fake iPhone, which is not true. It has a real IMEI number that matches. However, i do not have information on the long term quality of the phone yet.",5
470,"I bought this phone because it was specifically unlocked to AT&T.  When I received it, it wasn't unlocked, and tech support wanted me to go through a youtube video which prompted me to download an app that I didn't want or need.  Unbelievable.  I don't have time for this.",1
471,"Sad.  iPone8 1.Key pad types wrong letters & numbers, 2. doesn't switch apps 3. Finger print works limited 3. typing wrong letters/number/capitalization A LOT of time texting checking everything over nd over 4. ringer stopped workingData/typing freezes: email, text. Battery doesn't last. Email freezes, wont  attach pics documents.",1
472,"Needed a phone for my elderly mother, and this was perfect.  Overall quality and reliability are great on this refurbished model.  No scratches, dings, or cracks anywhere.  In addition, for this being an iPhone 8, battery life remains quite good.",5
473,"I’ve been using this phone for 3 weeks. Calls are so quiet that unless you’re in silent a silent room you can’t hear the call even with the volume turned all the way up. The keyboard occasionally doesn’t pop up- you have to turn the phone off and back on to get the keyboard working, made worse by the fact that it’ll only turn on after being turned off if it’s connected to power even if it’s fully charged. And there’s an annoying feedback noise on the playback of videos made using the front facing camera.So calls, text, and camera are bad. Hopefully Amazon honors the 90 day guarantee because I won’t be able to return it until next week and when I tried to return it to the seller it said that had to return it by tomorrow.",1
474,"The phone works great but I was disappointed with the amount of chips and scratches on the screen. I understand that I was ordering a refurbished phone but chips and large scratches on the screen are intolerable in my opinion. Rather than send it back to seller and wait Another week for a different phone, I just bought a new screen and replaced it myself. No other issues",3
475,"Phone is in great condition! I’ve owned it for 6 months now and still works great! Battery life was at 84% when I first got it, which is about the same my iPhone 7 was at when it cracked. It’s now down to 78% but still works fine!I liked that it came with a cute case so that saved me money!",5
476,El celular se encuentra en perfectas condiciones. Llegó con batería al 95%.  Lo adquirí para mi hijo de 11 años y está encantado. Hasta ahorita funciona bien.,5
477,Our daughter was easily able to transfer her number and all info by swapping her chip to the new phone. This new phone started communicating with her old phone as soon as she started setup. Was pretty darn cool to watch. Thought it would be a long half day ordeal changing everything over and phone number etc. Nope! She was up and running in know time! Whew!,5
478,"Phone came perfectly working as expected, very nice to come with a charger and i dont mind that it doesnt have a headphone jack adapter. Nothing wrong with the phone software wise, but there do seem to he quite a grea amount of scratches on the screen itself that are pretty shallow but still a lot for a renewed phone, you dont really notice them but i hope no one else gets a somewhat marked up phone like i did, besides that i love the phone and recommend this product if you need a cheap alternative to a pretty relevant iphone in 2020. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",5
479,"This seller/company are amazing between contacting them and Amazon both replaced my phone. My replaced phone was also sent with extra goodies, a screen protector and protective phone case. With the phone and charger. It did not come with SIM card key which was fine because I was happy to get the free screen protector and protective phone cover I can improvise and get the SIM card in and out and I only needed to unlock it to put the SIM card in so not a big deal at all. I give this company a satisfaction guaranteed! And will def use them in the future if needed!",4
480,The packaging was very good when it had came. No scratches or anything of that sort and very nice to use. Battery life is absolutely phenomenal and I would definitely recommend this to other people. I am very happy with this product.,5
481,"So far, so good.  The setting was easy and smooth.  It copied my contacts, photos, etc. from my other cell phone.  Now I have two phones with different numbers but the same settings/contents. It labels each as phone as iphone1and iphone2. TMobile is my cell provider.  I have been looking for a cell phone that can accommodate 2 numbers. The last time I checked, I was told that kind of phone doesn't exist (yet!).  I don't know if that is even possible. However, with today's technology, nothing is impossible. Happy to have extra cell phones that I use for my business plus another iphone that I used for personal.",5
482,"Fantastic used iPhone 8, works on Verizon without any problems. I was skeptical. Highly recommended. Be careful because some of the reviews seem to end up on multiple variations of listings. I recommend you double check to make sure the description of the specific phone you order specifies clearly that it will work with your carrier.",5
483,I purchased one of these and the speaker does not work well and people cannot hear me on the other end unless I use my AirPods or put on speakerphone. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! I tried messaging the seller and got no response.,1
484,It’s a great phone for a great price.  My o ly issue is that it was originally intended for sale in a country where you can’t silence the camera click noise.  Not a huge deal but it confused me for a while :/The battery life is excellent and the fingerprint is perfect - those were the two things that had gone wrong on my old iPhone 6 so I’m happy to have those functions back!,4
485,"The iPhone came in nearly perfect condition, only flaw was a tiny scratch near the speakers at the bottom. It had no issues at all running iOS 14, everything runs so smoothly and I was very impressed. I got this phone as a gift for my girlfriend as her first iPhone and it does very well to keep up with my iPhone XR at times, plus we got another iPhone 8 for her mother a few weeks after with no physical flaws at all. I couldn’t find face recognition but the fingerprint scanner on both phones work as intended. The battery can last a good work day, about 9-10 hours. Definitely worth checking out for the price!",5
486,"Got this particular phone because it came from Hybrid IT who gets great reviews from others. Phone was in nearly perfect condition, just a few barely noticeable scratches. One negative is the 79% battery, although it’s guaranteed to be at least 80% (hence the 4 stars, not 5). I’ll replace it at some point but still way less expensive than a brand new phone. It came with a charging cord & adapter, screen protector, and a SIM card removal tool. I was able to easily backup the new phone from iCloud and move the SIM card with no problems at all. Very happy so far and hope no issues arise. If they do I’ll come back here with an update.",4
487,The battery is having issue. iOS shows alert message asking me to go local authorized vendor to replace the battery. How is it possible? Just received 2 days. Please contact me asap to settle the case. Thanks.,1
488,"We bought this phone for an 8 year old to replace an iPhone 5C.  We took it to T-mobile to switch service from the old phone to the new one.  It was a snap. The new phone was in great condition and has face recognition, and a fingerprint reader.  We had a protective case and tempered glass to provide protection.  This was a super purchase!",5
489,"Received this iPhone 8 in the mail this afternoon. Came with a stuck home button, broken vibrate mode, nonfunctioning speaker phone, and randomly shuts off. Started the return process within several hours of receiving phone. Seller is CR Land.",1
490,"I purchased this phone from BuySPRY.  The phone works great, EXCEPT you cannot turn off the sound of the camera shutter.  It is a Japanese model.  In Japan, there is a law that phones must make a sound when taking a photo.  The sound does not play when taking a live photo, but in any app that uses the camera, it will make a sound when taking a still photo even if it is muted.  Quite annoying if you are trying to take a photo of something in a quiet room.",3
491,"Very nice phone, came almost brand new. It has a very small scratch on the screen but I can’t even tell it’s there. No scratches on back or anywhere else. It was fully unlocked and works well with my service. (Cricket Wireless) I upgraded from a 6S and my only complaint is the battery life not being much better than the 6s. However I know batteries tend to die down with age. The phone does charge pretty fast, came with its own charger, and it works perfectly. Would buy it again",5
492,"Amazing price for a newly refurbished 256GB storage red iPhone 8. I am exceedingly pleased with the purchase of this unlocked iPhone 8. It has worked flawlessly, and is in PERFECT condition. I loved the packaging and you all even included the pin to open it’s SD card with. Thank you.",5
493,Im always afraid that I'm going to buy a unlocked phone and it won't work with my T-Mobile network I carry. However when I bought this phone it worked just fine and she got home but the Sims in and we were good to go don't think twice get it,5
494,"In comparison to the 5, 6 and even 7, iPhone 8 is a step in the right direction by improving the phone in most aspects. The camera is better, Battery life is somewhat improved but far from perfect and it's bigger. I have no complaints with the iPhone 8.",5
495,I love my new phone. It is exactly as described in the listing. I will never purchase a brand new model when the renewed models are just as good and much less expensive. If you didn't know it was an older model you would think it was the latest being offered.  No scratches no noticeable defects and battery level is very good.,5
496,"I'm not happy with this phone, but it's too late to return it. The speaker feature doesn't work at all, and I can't make it loud enough to even talk on it normally. I'm very disappointed, I didn't pay a huge amount of money, but this makes it good, only for texts. Beware.",2
497,Upon opening it there were no damages to the device. It was perfect. Came with everything I needed. But the camera was down right awful! There’s a glitch inside the camera where it doesn’t take pictures properly. iPhones would usually take amazing pictures but this phone is no bueno. Everything else is rather decent. It still connected to my AirPods and all of that. But I will be replacing this phone soon. I definitely have to have a decent camera on my phone while traveling.Happy shopping!,3
498,Battery life kind of sucks. And screen looks like it’s been replaced. They should at least offer me a 10 percent refund,3
499,"Got this phone after my iphone 7 broke. quickly purchased without looking at customer reviews. This seller has quite a few bad reviews for this particular item listing. However most dating 2018. Luck may have played a part or maybe it was the seller having better products than before. I got a scratch less iphone 8. Exactly what i ordered, however battery health shows it only charges to 86%. Shows 100% but doesn’t actually get there. everything else works fine. so 4 out of 5",4
500,"I was shocked to see how well the phone had been maintained.It really was like new, as far as cosmetics go. The only negative is that the battery is only at about 80% capacity, or a little over it. However, this was stated in the product description - that the phones would  have at least 80% capacity, so no big deal.Just buy a charging case for the phone and you're set. It still works well and is snappy.",5
501,"Phone delivered fast , in pristine condition. Set up of all functions complete in about one hour. Battery life while not in use over night , went from 100% to 70 % in 9 hours. So far I rate purchase as outstanding . If long term function goes well , this will rate a happy face .",5
502,Was looking for a phone that had good volume and so far the phone has met that expectation.  The appearance of the phone that I received was also above expectations.  No whatsoever visible flaws.  So far very pleased with my order.,4
503,"I went to a Verizon store and low and behold they said that yes it is unlocked, but this model will only work with T-Mobile and AT&T. Had I known that I wouldn't have made the purchase. But i had to go with AT&T because I needed a phone right there and then. Its true it is unlocked, but the seller should have been more truthful and said that it is not compatible with many other carriers. So in essence it is semi-unlocked.",2
504,"Bought as a gift. My sister loved it. Not an Apple fan myself, but people seem to like them.",5
505,"This was my first iphone purchase. I was a little worried about purchasing a used one. However, the phone is a gem. In excellent condition. Good battery, takes great pictures. I like it so much I'm purchasing another used Iphone for my granddaughter.  I should have done this a long time ago.",5
506,This quit working completely within 4 months.  The battery health was under 80%.  The earpiece speaker was blown and just overall not in the condition they claimed it was in.  The phone now no longer works and when we took it to have it looked at the screws were completely stripped and it could not be opened without destroying the screen to fix it.  It no longer turns on due to a manufacturing defect with these phones and should have been checked with Apple before it was sold.,2
507,"I bought iPhone 8 from this seller, barely used for 3 days and from 4th day all of sudden the display is gone, touch isn’t working. So I asked for a refund and now they came up with, as it is customer damaged we can’t refund.There is not even a scratch on the screen.So i don’t recommend this seller for future purchases, had a worst experience.",1
508,Do simple to upgrade my 6 to an 8! Apple makes it easy. Everything from my last back up downloaded to my new phone. And great price!!,5
509,This phone has never worked well since I got it. The issue is that NO ONE can hear me when I call them or when they call me. They say it’s muffled. I asked for help from seller and was told to restart the phone or update it. Nothing worked. I have to now buy another phone.,1
510,"I was skeptical after seeing both wonderful and poor reviews of refurbished phones. We are thrilled with our purchase! It looks brand new, appears to have a good battery life, and connected to our carrier with no issues.Siri was difficult to set up, but everything else has been a great deal!",5
511,"The phone itself psychically was great and in perfect condition. But after I  got it activated and started receiving calls I  noticed The  volume on the speaker was very low and barely could hear people on the phone. So now I’m going through the process of returning the phone and I’ll write again on my experience with this process. Kinda just wanted a exchange but on returning it they say only refunds. FYI, I’m not phone stupid I  did All the steps to fix the issue and it wasn’t something silly from a option on the phone with the volume.",2
512,The phone is blacklisted on the Verizon network as not being paid for so it cannot be activated! Not only did they blacklist the phone they also did my grandsons phone number! What a mess getting that all straightened out! Very unhappy customer!,1
513,"I got the phone a day early so that was a good start, but the figure print reader had minor issues and something takes a bit to work. The battery life is not that great I mean I have an iPhone 6 and that battery lasted a long time this one dies after a few hours. But what I paid for it I guess it’s what you should expect. Better than no phone at all lol",5
514,"Setup was a breeze! From the moment you turn the phone on the phone practically setup itself. U answer a few questions,  and all data is transferred.  I took it to T-mobile to switch the Sim card. But that's it!! Easy peasy!!!",5
515,This renewed phone came in perfect condition.  No scratches or any signs of use.  It even still had a few months of original Apple warranty - though I know that is not the case most of the time.  Would definitely recommend Amazon Renewed for quality.,5
516,"I was initially super worried about buying a renewed phone, especially with apple's battery issues. I bought this for my dad, and everything was pretty much new without the apple packaging. The battery life indicator as well as a few apps to check indicated that the battery was at 98-99% capacity, which is basically next to new. I am very pleased with it.",5
517,"Phone arrived sooner than expected, looked absolutely brand new, and after I put my SIM card in, it was up and running. It’s been perfect so far! It charges to 100 % and stays charged all day! Great deal for a great phone!",5
518,The phone had spam texts as soon as i turned it onIt stayed hot my flashlight on the phone never workedI had to keep my case off just to get it to stay on,1
519,This product came in good shape but with a completely bad battery. The phone would work until you got to around 50% and the. Would randomly shut off! I had to buy a battery 1 day after I received it and it cost me another $70.00... I bought the 2 year warrant and paid an extra $70.00 for that! I use my phone for business and don’t have time to send it in for warranty so I just paid outta pocket to prevent the inconvenience. I am always worried about buying used things online for this exact reason. With that said the phone works perfect after the new battery was installed. I will be very reluctant to buy used electronics online in the future. (Which was my gut feeling in the first place!!),3
520,This phone was horrible it wouldn’t work it won’t update its shuts off it won’t keep service it was just a total disaster but Amazon gave our refund back 100% no issue I love Amazon I shop slot on there  I recommend Amazon no matter what they got ya back,1
521,"Purchased for my wife. She loves it. Battery life is excellent, device looks like new. Not a scratch. This is our first Apple product. Operation is different from Android phones, but it seems easier for her to operate. Overall a great device, worth the price.",5
522,Battery dies nit hold a charge longer than an hour or two…really bad deal.,1
523,"Great buy! iPhone 8 256GB still up and running good! Had one body drop mark and I dropped it as well adding another but once a case is on it’s irrelevant and unseen- overall I’m glad I purchased through this seller, will buy again soon I’m sure.",5
524,"Todo esta bien,mi único error fue escoger el celular más pequeño es lo que no me gusto.e estado notando que la batería del cel ,se descarga muy rápido,no entiendo que le pasa a mi cel. Pensé que estaría exelente todo",4
525,The phone worked perfectly!! But it had few scratches on it which they didn’t mention on the description.. false advertisement.,1
526,"I was surprised at the high price for a phone that came out 3 years ago. The phone looks like it's in like-new condition. It arrived spotlessly clean in an Amazon branded box with an aftermarket charger. According to the ""battery health"" function in the phone, the battery is at 86% of original capacity. Not bad.",3
527,"Do not buy from this seller (ReFoned) the phone they sent me stopped working after two weeks. Wouldn’t charge. I returned the phone and they tried to only issue a refund of half the purchase price as a “restocking fee” the seller wanted to keep $104 of my purchase price for returning the faulty phone they sent me. Which is completely unacceptable, I had to call Amazon and file a claim for the rest of my money.",1
528,This is a very good reconditioned phone my phone didn’t even have a scratch on it the battery life was like new the amount of storage is good the only drawback is the iPhone 8 only has a 4.7 screen if you want a larger screen you need to order a iPhone 8 Plus I highly recommend this phone,5
529,"This seemed to be a good deal, until I realized that I could not hear anyone on regular function.  Speaker phone worked well, but that's not feasible in all situations. The touch screen was finicky.  Touch once, did nothing.  Touch harder or twice, and took me into view settings for that function. Returned without a problem.",2
530,"So far so good no issues at all battery is good finger print is good cameras are good no glitching or freezing , it’s charges good but I will update in a month or so",5
531,"The advertisement that appeared in the website is false. This item is locked; it is not according to the description. I have been searching several ways to unlock this item, and anyone of them, has resolved the problem. This is a real fraud, I am really upset and disappointed of this purchase. I need a refund. The dammit deal or problem is, I do not live in United State, I was taking vacation in Florida 2 weeks ago, and I decided to make the purchase, trusting in the dammit description of the IPhone.",1
532,The phone looked great. Some minor scuffs on the metal case. Battery life was 80%. That was the minimum promised. Major problem was the camera shook when I tried to take pictures. Pictures came out super blurry. Company was easy to work with. Sent the phone back for free and got my refund the next day. Their policy is 72 hours to refund. Great company. Too bad about the phone.,1
533,The iPhone was all that I expected. I was comfortable with a refurbished phone because I knew Amazon would stand behind it and would have no reason to sell anyone a defective or misrepresented product. I'm pleased.,5
534,"It was never mentioned in the Amazon ad that it is Refurbished item, they used a different terminology.I have a 90 days warranty so I'm still observing  its performance. Actually I didn't mind it's used for that price it's alright.",4
535,"I order iPhone 8 as my primary phone broke and meanwhile I needed a phone to get by my day to day activities. This was my first ever encounter with buying a renewed phone and I was skeptical at first but I was pleasantly surprised.The phone came in a generic box with a iPhone compatible generic charger. Which was what I expected but seller went ahead and send a cover for the same. Which was kind of great.Coming to the phone itself. There were no scratches, cracks, or dent whatsoever with the phone. Had it been delivered in a genuine apple box I couldn’t have distinguished it from brand new phone. Battery life seems to be great. Every seems to be working great. Will definitely add more once I’ve used it for a while. Total bang for the bucks.",5
536,I bought two: one for me and one for my husband. My husbands has not had any issues. Mine occasionally sounds like I’m a robot or other people sound like robots and battery life is awful. You get what you pay for.,3
537,I have to say this was fast shipping as my 7 plus motherboard died i needed a cheaper version. The shipping was fast. The wire and block that came with it were dirty knockoffs thy didn’t work. The phone was just thrown in some random phone box.Aside from that the phone was in great condition. No scratches no cracks. And the battery life which i was absolutely shocked at was 100%Good cheap buy for a good phone. I would recommend.,5
538,"I took a flyer and purchased this ""renewed"" iPhone and am very happy I did.  I arrived with all that was included, started up right away and even worked with my present SIM card.  Just can't get better than that!",5
539,This is the first iPhone I bought for a family member they liked the phone but once again the charger broke in half the first day the tried to use it I want these sellers to know that whenever you buy a phone the charger is jus as important as the phone I was blessed because I already had a iPhone charger.,4
540,"This phone quit working properly right after the 90 days return window. When attempting to talk to someone on phone, you can hear the other person but they cannot hear you. This is not a problem with other person’s phone because it happens on every incoming and outgoing call made from this phone. In all fairness, there are no problems with texting, games, etc. but the main purpose of a phone for me is to make or receive calls. This is not an occasional problem, it is every phone call made or received. Also, I did not drop phone, get it in water, or do anything to damage phone. The phone has been in an Otterbox Defender since the day I got it.",1
541,"The exterior of the phone is in great condition for it being refurbished, the only thing I did not like was the battery life capacity is at 78% I probably would not buy another one unless the battery life was better. Overall good phone considering I’ve only had it for a couple of days.",3
542,This item came with a damaged main screen. I am not willing to keep this iPhone for fear it would break immediately after its 90 day warranty expires. I decided to return this item before ever even using it.,2
543,I have bought several products from Amazon that have been renewed. It's a great way to save money and still get a good product. This iPhone was no different.,5
544,"This product came as a complete disappointment, broken, turned on and off whenever it felt like, it didn’t keep charge. The turn on/off button wasn’t even working properly and the was a glimpse  of light showing in the lower left side of the screen. Trademore’s customer service was horrible. Even though they accepted the refund request immediately, they never gave me the money back ( it took me a month of begging them!) and Amazon finally stepped in and gave me my refund. I bought another phone from them at the same time, the other phone seems to be working just fine.",1
545,"Physically the phone functions and looks great. The only drawback is that the phone is likely from Japan or another country that has laws requiring camera shutter sounds to always be on so I can’t take selfies because everyone around me will hear it, and the sound isn’t quiet.",4
546,Needed a phone with more memory.  This one had it and it is working as advertised.  I've had no issues with it since it arrived (knocking on wood very hard right now!!!).  Have not used face recognition or fingerprint features.,5
547,"Very great product, especially for the price. Came very quickly with charger and packaged very nicely. Battery life is great, very durable. Very minor scratches on back glass. I have used and tested this product for about 5 months. I can’t compare it to any other renewed devices. It performs so greatly for being renewed. The camera quality it awesome. After some research I found out that nothing had been replaced, and it still had apple care capabilities if I wanted to take it to Apple to fix if the screen broke.",5
548,I received an iPhone 8 that was purchased as an upgrade for my sons 13th birthday this phone is listed as fully unlocked on amazon when we tried to activate it through our phone service they were unable to do so because the phone is said to be listed with a carrier already. Now we have a phone that while it appears to look great does not work for our service provider so does us NO GOOD!!! How disappointing to have purchased this as a gift only to have to turn around and tell someone it’s not able to be activated. I don’t know how well it works because I cannot even activate it.,1
549,It came with some visible marks on the back side of the phone and the charger that came along looks cheap. black plug and white cable. Looks a bit funny to the sight. I am hoping that it wont cause any issues in long run.,3
550,It worked great and looks great,5
551,"amazon asked about face recognition, don't think the 8 has that so no stars there. Generic box, generic charger and cable- tossed those in the trash as I don't trust them but after a week the phone has worked well and we are satisfied. No lightning to headphone adapter.",5
552,"Everything works perfectly! I love it soo much! At first i was sceptical due to comments but now I'm glad i did it. No scratches, everything works, fully unlocked. I live in the Caribbean",5
553,The phone was broken and missing the tray the sim NBC and goes in. I can’t even get the phone turned on. The battery life is also very short.this is a horrible phone and I am so disappointed. I have sent many emails to refund or send me a new phone. I sent back the  the other phone a few weeks ago and getting really upset. The phone is the only way to contact people and I spent 200 dollars on it. If I have to take legal actions I will. Thank you I love Amazon so hope this is resolved or I won’t be buying from a Manson ever again.,1
554,This was my husbands first time getting a iPhone and he said he wasn’t getting calls. I contacted the seller and they agreed to exchange it for us. When my husband got home(he’s a truck driver) I asked to see the phone. Long story short is was on do not disturb 😆Great phone and excellent customer service!!!!,5
555,"I was a bit hesitant to buy a used iPhone, especially since (1) is just replaced the battery in my current iPhone twice in 26 months ad (2) they specifically didn’t guarantee battery life over 80% — which is when my current iPhone started to go kerflooie.Well: battery life was 100%, the phone case and glass were in A-1 condition.  I was so pleased.",5
556,Needed a replacement and was shocked to find that we could buy this at such a great price.  The battery life was around 90% and the phone appeared to be brand new otherwise!  This is definitely the way to go when buying for those who may not take care of an expensive phone under a 2y contract!,5
557,Battery was trash. Got it home plugged it in and it would only work while it was on the charger. Took it to a cellphone repair place and they said they battery was garbage. It wouldn’t turn out without a charger. 76 dollars later we have a new charger. I believe that you had to know it was a bad battery otherwise how did you know that it worked?,1
558,"This is the second referb iPhone I’ve bought from Amazon.  They work perfectly, and look perfect when you get them.  In general electronics either work, or they don’t.  So if you’re going to have a problem you’re going to know it right out of the box.  My next iphone will be another amazon referb.",5
559,"I bought these phones for my kids for Christmas. Two of the three are perfectly fine, but the third one has a screen that is deeply gouged. I understand they are refurbished but come on. So now I have to spend the extra $50 to have the screen replaced as opposed to dealing with the hassle of trying to return it and chance it not being here on time.",3
560,"very pleased. Unless we knew it was a refurb, I would not have guessed. Cosmetically excellent, great battery life, clean, no issues at all.Basically the New-iPhone-Experience for 50% less.",5
561,"This company provides beautiful renewed products! 🙂 I wanted to allow some time to pass before writing a review. I couldn't be happier!I'm very skeptical making larger purchases online especially when it comes to tech products. I'm so glad I took the great deal this company offered as they delivered my phone with perfect quality 10/10.  I purchased the phone renewed and it arrived in seemingly brand new condition, everything works like new. A glitch once in a while is normal for all iPhones and I still haven't even seen one! I've been enjoying this phone every day since I received it ✌🏼",5
562,This was shipped very quickly.  The phone performs well.  It was the replacement for the fatally damaged iPhone 8 which my son had become very fond of.  Glad I made this replacement purchase.  Price was right.,5
563,"This phone is ~40% less that a comparable phone at A. T. & T.  Getting it set up with my carrier was as simple as moving the SIM card from my old phone to this phone.  Once there, all I had to do was get the software upgraded to the latest version of IOS and restore from backup.  It has worked flawlessly since.",5
564,I bought one of these only to find it was originally Korean or Chinese because in silent mode the camera still makes a very loud shutter sound (to adhere to their privacy laws)....and there is NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF! So I bought a second one....only to have it to the EXACT SAME THING....so BOTH are being returned. Don't waste your time.,1
565,"I don't always leave reviews, but I felt I really needed to for this seller because of their great customer service. I ordered a gold iPhone 8, and it came earlier than expected, which was great. For a refurbished phone, I was impressed because it still looked brand new (no scratches).  There was a concern about the volume on the phone, but they immediately resolved my concern. They were so kind and understanding. If I ever need another refurbished phone in the future, I will definitely consider them first.",5
566,"I got this phone as a no data device for my 5th grade daughter.  We were initially thrilled by its capabilities as it seemed to work as a brand new phone would. Quickly we realized we weren’t going to get much battery life out of it, but in the last month it has been challenging for my daughter to use the phone for more than 30 minutes without a cord.  Very disappointed as we were hoping this would last her through middle school.  Do not recommend.",1
567,since it was my first I-Phone there should have been some SET-UP instructions included but besides that the phone works great.  I ordered two and both work.  One for me the other for my wife.,5
568,It came in perfect condition no scratches nothing I checked the battery percentage came at a 99 percent which I was shocked to see when I got it it was an easy setup it was unlocked works perfectly I'm very happy with this purchased,5
569,"I purchased the phone and it arrived quickly. Spent a great deal of time price comparing on the front end, so had been quite excited. Within the first few days, the phone would randomly shut off all on it's own, not pick up wi-fi, internet connection or even recognize service. This happened several times a day. It was quite irritating. Would not purchase again.",1
570,Had no trouble at all in the setup and phone came with 100% battery health and no scratches or cosmetic damages. Some reviews say their phone was GSM only and did not work with their carrier. Be sure you check which phone you are getting because some did not say fully unlocked. I ordered the silver and all i did was switch my SIM card over and everything was there. Didn't even have to contact my carrier,5
571,Came in good condition,5
572,"I got the phone and it looked great nothing is wrong with the phones software or anything but when I went to get it activated couldn't even activate, the guy showed me his screen and it said ""phone is not elegable on this network"", and when you checked the phone to see what the carrier would be it said it was sprint. Customer doesn't fuckkng exist so I'm just returning and getting my money back dont buy this!",1
573,"If this is what is called “ Fully refurbished”then I don’t know what the so so refurbished must be like .Very disappointed so far .Keeps cutting communication, & at times it’s not even registering when I call someone .Or people call me & neither of us can hear the other , says reconnecting then shuts the number . I’m going to Apple Store next week & have checked out again .!!!May have to return before July if these problems continue .",1
574,"I got this with international shipping to South Africa, the packaging seemed really secured. And still, I received a half cracked home button on this phone. I’m highly doubtful it was due to shipment damage, this was meant to be a gift so I’m very VERY disappointed. The post clearly stated that the phone was “Professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned to work and look like new.”. I provided some images but my old phone doesn’t have the best camera quality. If you’re looking for a seller who keeps their promises, this is not the place to purchase from. I don’t recommend at all!",1
575,I had to get a new battery for this phone becaue it would not stay on. The phone was out of warrany and I do not expect the seller to repair this becaue I did not purchase the extended warranty. When I took the phone to get a new battery they siad its missing parts and the battery is just flopping around. It had one screw holding the internal parts in. The company said they will not work on it because it was so badly refrubished that I will have continual issues with it. I contacted the seller to try and reslove the issue but they have not contaced me back. I am stuck with a dead phone that is useless. AVOID THIS SELLER!!!,1
576,"People are right about the camera!!! Even when you try to silence the camera it still makes noise, even on apps like Snapchat, etc. Haven’t had any other problems so far tho...Update: I returned the phone. It overheats while on the charger if you’re using it at the same time and will keep powering off it untilIt cools off. Don’t waste your time.",3
577,The iPhone 📱 works fine.The battery life is good. Touchscreen works fine but it had few scratches here and there.,4
578,La batería se descarga fácilmente a lo largo del día incluso dejando el celular en modo de avión. Con un uso moderado es necesario cargar la batería antes de las 12 horas. Le llegué a cambiar la batería y sigue haciendo lo mismo.,3
579,"Far superior camera to my old Android phone.  Good battery life.  Smooth and slick screen transitions.  A ""Cadillac"" phone if there ever was one.  Fingerprint reader is a very nice touch.",5
580,Not satisfied with the used iphone 8 I recently purchased.  The packaging was good and it came with the charger.  It setup nicely and worked fine for a few hours.  All of a sudden the is shuts off randomly.  Not sure if its the battery and/or software.  It currently does have the latest software and ot charges when its on (only).  I may need to return it.,2
581,Yeah iPhone was as described which is good. I wanted to write a quick review because the charger brick did not work when we got it. I reached out to the seller and they apologized and immediately shipped out a new brick. Great service!,5
582,"This phone is defective and I am not getting a response when attempting to contact seller. You can’t hear people during phone calls, you have to either have the phone connected to Bluetooth headphones or use speakerphone. Also this pop up keeps coming up and the phone restarts. I bought this as a gift for my mom and it’s not usable due to these problems.",1
583,Love this iPhone!! Easy for my daughter to use! LOTS of storage! (My daughter is Special Needs and doesn’t use the face recognition nor the fingerprint reader. Sorry if that’s not helpful.) VERY Satisfied Customer CJDAVIS,5
584,I bought two phones from this seller and one of them didn’t work. I contacted the seller and they stood behind their work and sent another phone to us after we sent the other one back. I will definitely buy from them again. They work like brand new phones!,5
585,"Great phone.  I've had it for several weeks now and it's worked very well, like new!  The battery life is good, as well as the picture quality.  It was super-easy to set up and transfer all the data from my old phone.  Very pleased!",5
586,Phone sucks. It lags. It won’t hold a charge. It’s impossible to hear on whenever you’re talking on the phone. 100% will not recommend this.,1
587,Speaker stopped working after a month. Very disappointed. Phone glitches almost everyday.,1
588,"I had this phone for about 2 month. It was working really well besides for the fact that it had issues charging. (i was using the supplied cord) now the phone wont charge at all, even trying to charge wirelessly with other cords and trying to hard reset. It is totally dead and now i have to try to figure out how to fix it because i now have no phone during quarantine.",2
589,"I was skeptical about ordering a phone from this company went my daughter phone broke.  But I took a chance.  Once I received it I called Verizon and it was easy to set up, no problems and $150 cheaper than buying from Verizon directly.  Where I live we can only use CDMA phones so I was nervous.  Again worked great",5
590,"The phone was glitchy and had extremely poor battery health. Now I have to pay for return shipping, as a prime member. I will never ever buy any electronic devices from Amazon again.",1
591,Product did not work. Seller not helpful.,1
592,"I’ve always liked iPhones, and this one is my favorite so far. It fits my pocket just right, and is easy to use. So far, the battery is performing quite well. A big improvement over my old phone!",5
593,"It was time to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and I took a chance with this renewed iPhone 8. It looks like new, works great and I’ve found no problems so far. Battery still has 86% life so better than expected.",5
594,"The battery does not work,  last just a couple hours or nothing I think it was old because ask me for a change , I wanted send it back but I just have not time and now it's on the drawer expecting a new battery",3
595,I’ve had problems since I received it. It occasionally won’t stay on for more than 5 minutes at a time and I have to factory reset to get it to stop. Now the microphone doesn’t work— I’ve tried cleaning it and resetting it. I’ve had this phone less than 3 months.Support told me I’d have to contact Apple to get it fixed— waste of my time and money.,1
596,"I wish I could give zero stars. I paid $280 for a faulty phone. I received it Friday and upon having it plugged in and setting up the phone, it flashed on and off for about an hour then came on for about an hr and hasn’t been back on since. I cannot get the phone to come back on to get Apple ID off and was not able to turn on the find my iPhone bc the phone kept going off during setup. They state I cannot return the phone until I get Apple ID turned off. This is a scam!!! Do NOT buy a phone from them. How they are still selling here amazes me.",1
597,I bought this phone for my daughter and she is very happy with it. Everything works as it should and it looks brand new.,5
598,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it! I was skeptical about the purchase because it was a refurbished iPhone but it worked out great! She’s had no complaints at all. And it came unlocked so I was able to take it to my local Merry PCS store and have it activated immediately. I’d purchase this phone again...,5
599,I ordered three phones  of these one for me and the other two for my two daughters and let me tell you that they work fine they came in this nice box with their chargers I’m really satisfied with them they have been working great so I am happy,5
600,"Camera does not work, we tried to reset to factory settings to get the camera to work then the phone was not recognizing passcode. We had to end up restoring and camera still does not work.  Everything else works.",3
601,This has been an awesome refurbished phone. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever - Sprint hooked it up with no issues and I had officially made the switch from Galaxy to iPhone and I am never looking back.,5
602,As mentioned below I found the phone to bend easily. Also it doesn’t lay flat on a surface. Upper Left corner raises up. Also the turn on button is flush with the surface of phone so difficult to ‘turn on’! I took my new protective case off to help but that didn’t improve. I know it’s a ‘refurbished phone’ but I wonder what condition it was in ‘prior’?,3
603,"I knew that a renewed product would mean that the battery had some use to it, and I'm finding that to be true. No matter if I disable bluetooth, wifi, etc...it just doesn't last long. Just be aware. Physically the product was flawless and came nicely packed.",4
604,"It came in better condition than my old iPhone 8 which was bought on the Apple website. There’s no scratches or issues with the phone itself. It’s exactly as advertised, perfect!",5
605,"I specifically ordered this phone to be compatible with T-mobile. I called my carrier because the phone wouldn't connect to the cellular network and they looked up the phone information and said this phone is not in their records to have ever been a tmobile phone and that it isnt compatible. The phone only works with wifi, I'm processing a return/refund process, i'm very disappointed",1
606,Very low quality iPhone 8. Battery continues to fail and the screen also died. I am now forced to buy and install a replacement screen if I want to keep this phone functional. Pure junk.,1
607,"It came with issues. Does phone has difficulty connecting to WIFI, I have to restart the phone often and that is very annoying. The phone came dirty, they didn’t even bother to clean the outside of the cell that I guess that was the same poor job they did to “clean” the inside of the phone",4
608,"Fantastic customer service.  I bought 2 of these by mistake. T-mobile said my employees phones were iPhone 6S. They turned out to be iPhone 8, same as these.Customer service took them back with no problems. Now I need another pair of newer phones.",5
609,"Camera did not work, we were able to return tho so that’s good",2
610,I was definitely a bit concerned of buying it due to the reviews and this was my first time buying a phone offline but I must say this phone is perfect it came just how it looks and just how it says with a charger and screen protector already on the phone. And the battery life is amazing,5
611,Best renewed product I've ever seen. It looks mint/brand-new!!,5
612,The only thing that I’ve noticed with this phone is the battery dies off a quick I’m a be returning it to get a new one because it is quite ridiculous the other phone that I had the battery lasted forever,5
613,"Just as advertised! I literally cannot find a single flaw with this refurbished phone, inside and out. I popped my Tracfone SIM Card in and it activated immediately. Definitely worth the money! Highly Recommend",5
614,"Great value, however the battery performance is at 95% out of the box.  Also, no ear pods.  Otherwise, great value and no cosmetic or other defects with the phone.  Mine came with a tempered glass protector courtesy of the original owner.",4
615,Great quality!,5
616,"Works great -- battery lasts longer than my current iPhone 8s, and wayyyy longer than the old 6 this was meant to replace. Looks and works like new. 10/10 would buy again.",5
617,"You know you are in trouble when you receive a card in the box saying to please not contact Amazon if you have any problems, just contact them. The phone did not tun on for two days. When it did it randomly shuts off and restarts. The screen blacks out and when trying to get it to turn on it called 911 and set off emergency alarm while still blackouted screen. I do not have another phone to use and no money to wait 14 days after get the phone for a refund. It looks like they are just repackaging this phone and reselling t to the next sucker who orders this phone. No customer service at all!!!!! They knew was defective phone when sent.",1
618,My company phone that was turned in at Retirement was the I8 and the Renewed one I purchased works just like my old one battery is good and cosmetics a great. would recommend for those without the need for 5G pricing,5
619,Had a Russian 3rd party software or permissions something one it. My iTunes was high jacked. Had to reset the phone and remove the permissions ans reset again,1
620,"This was, by leaps and bounds, the best quality refurbished phone I have ever purchased. Unfortunately, due to an error on my part, I will be needing to return it. I would HIGHLY recommend this seller.",5
621,Getting a refurbished item is a hit or miss. Ordered  iphone 7 last Nov2019 and it was pristine. Ordered Iphone 8 last week and glass has too many scratches that I ended up returning. For $350 I expected something presentable at least even if it is an old model😩,1
622,"I finally had to replace my iPhone SE after I botched a shattered screen replacement. I'm not the type to buy into the latest model phone and I also knew that I liked TouchID. Seeing that the series 8 was the last to use the feature, I bit the bullet and upgraded. Not having the 3.5mm jack anymore didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. It shipped promptly and now I'm enjoying a iPhone 8 that works like new, but cost me way less. Thanks!",5
623,"I like it, it help keeping communication between families and friends. helping in studies",5
624,Phone was manufactured for Asian markets therefore I am unable to silence the camera shutter sound. Returning for refund.,2
625,The quality was definitely not the same as getting one from my T-Mobile store. It was very cheap and fragile feeling compared to the one I have now. I never played with it. As soon as I opened it and felt the quality of just the structure of the phone I sent it back.,1
626,"I did not notice when I bought it because I have kept using ATT network. However, I went to another country, and tried to use a local USIM, then I found that this phone is locked. I contacted ATT to unlock the phone, but I kept failing. I don't know what happened this phone, but I had to buy another phone to the local USIM.I contacted ATT to unlock the phone, but they said ""The IMEI provided is not a valid AT&T IMEI"".",1
627,"The battery was dead which made the phone unusable from the start! I put a new battery in it for another &50. Adding to the price of purchase! When someone calls me I cannot hear what they are saying not even with the loudspeaker turned on! VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Will NEVER buy another phone from this seller!!",1
628,The glue is coming out<,3
629,"The Iphone 8 had little cosmetic wear, it looked very good. The problem was that the earpiece of the phone was barely audible. If you went to speaker phone it worked fine. I called the seller and they claimed all phones were fully tested? I do not agree. They said return it to Amazon.",1
630,"Phone arrived quickly, well packaged.  It really looks like a brand new phone. I switched the chip from my old phone and it works just fine. I happy[y with it  so far.",5
631,"So far, so good! Have had this phone for one week and it's serving me well. Miss the earphone jack, but worth having a phone that works and costs less than new ones. I'll update if anything changes.",4
632,"Like new, i have had this phone for 6 months now with no problems at all. Really happy with my renewed phone it treated me like a new phone would. Saved alot of money buying used and i get to use fingerprint reader which i wish apple would bring back on newer phones.",5
633,"Renewed iPhone is great. The charger however, a thin black plastic replacement. I travel. Unlike the Apple charger, this plug portion cannot be replaced w an alternate country's plug. It also fits too loosely in the wall. Had to use a floor strip to keep it plugged. I know accessories can be replacements, but they have to have same function/capabilities. Hoping I can get a comparable one sent by the seller. Amazon responded quickly to the complaint, however, and gave me a credit for a future purchase.",3
634,"The phone came quicker than expected; the delivery was on point. I was actually nervous about buying the phone but it is better than I expected. The only defect on the phone was a small prick where the SIM card is place; it looked as though someone used something else to try and open it. As for the battery, it last for a full day because I work with my phone and always in the Wifi zone. Otherwise, I think it’s safe to say good buy..... I’ve had it for almost one month now.",4
635,"The battery life, touch screen and camera quality are all great. I especially like the ease of setup (less than 5 minutes)!I’m a return customer and I look forward to more purchases in the future!!",5
636,"After 18 months the phone will not charge.It makes a loud sound when taking video or a picture.The screen is way too bright at the lowest setting.Garbage, I’ve purchased 7 different chargers in year.Don’t buy.",1
637,Super easy to set up. I am not a tech savvy person and it was really easy for me. Transferred my Verizon chip and Apple ID and was set up perfectly in less than an hour.,5
638,"I was a little skeptical of buying this after reading some of the reviews, but I’ve had this phone for about 5 months now and haven’t had a single issue. I love it, and was well worth the price. Everything worked well, the phone itself was in good physical condition, no scratches. I’d buy again.",5
639,Could not get this phone to connect to the Verizon network.  Worked with Verizon Customer Service and Technical Support for over four hours with no success. Took the phone to a Verizon store in case the old Sim Card was a problem but even with a new card the phone still wouldn't work.Elected to send the phone back to BuySPRY for a refund.,1
640,I have ordered two phones from them and they are both in top working quality. Customer service is on point and very helpful. I am so glad i ordered from them. Thank you.,5
641,"Phone did not work. An account was still opened with AT&T. So it would not work with T-Mobile. Phone returned, waiting on my refund.",1
642,"My phone came in great condition and worked perfect for about 2 weeks and then it started shutting off automatically and keeping a black screen while I could still touch and feel the fingerprint vibrate, it has a grey line that shows across the screen while it does what I explain above. I have service on my phone and I pay my phone bill but it always says “no service” and my phone doesn’t work.I paid almost 500$ for a phone that is defective and doesn’t work still..",1
643,"This is just as described like brand new. You can not find another phone at this price in as good of condition. I was able to place my sim and set up was as easy as 1,2,3. Very fast shipping. Would highly recommend! Amazing product and price!!",5
644,"No scratches on screen or glass on the back of the phone. Came with some fingerprint marks and dust, but nothing you can't wipe off. The phone functions perfectly, all features of a new iPhone 8. Battery saves on some apps, but others it drains fast. Not sure if its the app's size, or phone's battery. Overall it works, functions, and looks just like a brand new phone. The only thing is that it doesn't come with a generic Apple charger, it comes with a cheaper one that takes longer to charge, and also no earbuds. I would highly recommend.",5
645,"I’ve been using a 6s with 16Gb for 2 years and it finally died for good. So, I upgraded to the 8 and let me tell you this is huge upgrade for me. It’s the exact same feel and look but better. The display is nicer, fingerprint scanner is faster, and the over speed is better. When phone came it’s actually looked brand new. No scraps or scratches or worn down buttons. You forget that it was a refurbished phone. So far 10/10 for me.",5
646,"Me llego estado nuevo, funciona todo y lo estético está 10/10, no le doy 5 estrellas porque me hubiera gustado que venga con los accesorios originales.",4
647,Excellent phone with battery life more than 86%. So far all functions are working great. This seller did great job of refurbished iphone8. I would buy again from this seller.,5
648,I bought from buyspry and I could not be happier. Phone looks and responds like it’s brand new. I have a safe link SIM card and I used to have a Samsung phone. I popped in the SIM card and it worked immediately. In the box I got a charger cord and a charger box along with something to take out the SIM card tray. They may not be what you get in a regular iPhone box but it all works great. Also it did come in a generic smartphone box. I definitely do not regret this purchase. Phone absolutely looks brand new.,5
649,"The iPhone 8 I received was better Than expected. The screen had very minor scruffs under the home button that could only be seen when holding the phone at odd angles. There was also a bigger scuff in the bottom corner of the back glass but was fixed with a case. Other then those minor issues the phone was great, it came in on time, had good packaging, battery life was way better than expected, and was overall a great purchase, that I would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap Iphone.",4
650,"Super happy with this purchase. It works perfectly and I’ve had absolutely no issues.Also I have no issue with being able to turn the camera sound on/off as I read in comments before purchasing, so I was nervous but I can turn it off and on no problem.",5
651,I purchased this phone beginning of Feb 2020.  I have been using it for 11 months.  It acts like a brand new phone.  I haven’t had a single issue.  Battery life seems normal.  I doubt I will ever buy new again!,5
652,I purchased this device as a temporary replacement for a phone that died. In the time I used it everything functioned perfectly and other than a spot on the bezel around the charging port where the finish was worn it looked brand new. According to the built-in battery health utility it was in need of service but it lasted me all day with frequent use.All in all I would buy another without a second thought.,5
653,"Arrived a day early around noon.  Boxed appropriately. Fully charged and battery performance is excellent so far.  My old phone’s battery was near death, then it got sprinkled on in the rain and I knew I had to replace it ASAP.  Considering I don’t want to spend $1K on a phone, I took a chance and crossed my fingers.I am very happy and would buy again from them.",5
654,When I checked he IMEI my carrier sent me this. “There is still a balance owed to another carrier on this device. Please contact your current carrier for details.“ I was very disappointed.,1
655,"Phone worked fine for right at a year and then would not turn on. The Geek Squad at Best Buy said it could be the battery, but there was no guarantee that exchanging the battery would work. Was hoping it would last a bit longer.",2
656,Phone came in perfect physical condition. No scratches. Looks brand new! Did take a bit to get it set up as the phone didn’t come with the newest software and it wouldn’t restore from the backup on my old phone without a software update. Battery life says it’s at 85% capacity but so far it has been great! Well worth the price!,4
657,Nice product.  No scratches at all.  The only problem i have was the cell phone was making noise in the box.  It should have been secured to prevent from knocking the box during shipping.  Beside that all is well.  Thank God the phone is fine. That is why i gave 4 stars instead of 5.,4
658,Purchased for friend in Columbia.  Works great there.,5
659,"I bought this for my daughter in April, and now in December it doesn't work.  Nobody can hear her when she calls.  Of course it's out of warranty so I'm out $250+.  Here you go Amazon, stick it!",1
660,Got this to upgrade a family member from a 6 and they love it! No problem setting up new phone and  seems to be working great with no issues. Will update if anything changes. Packages was awesome and arrived quickly. Like new condistiob and battery life seems to be good for a renewed phone so far very happy with this product.,5
661,"I returned this Apple 8. I charged it to the full battery. I started to set it up with the internet, and?Started to go round and around endlessly. I couldn’t pass through the settings.! I returned!",3
662,"I ordered 2 phones and both were in excellent condition. One looked brand new, and the other one had some tiny scuffs on the bezel. They both work really well.",5
663,"This phone will not let me download any apps at all, Zoom, Duo, WebEx, Messenger, WebEx Meet. NOTHING!!!! It won’t remind ma of meetings, appointments even though I set it up in my calendar to do so. And it always tells me my password is wrong even when I change it as instructed to. I have missed so many meetings because of the many issues with this phone. This phone is wack. I thought y’all tests these products like you test for COVID-19?",1
664,The renewed phone already had 818 charge cycles. Battery should have been replaced in renewing before sale. Apple recommends replacing battery after 500 cycles due to battery degradation. Battery discharges quickly,1
665,"Nothing about this phone seems used. Extremely pleased with the appearance, quality and price. This ‘used’ phone had 4x the memory at a much lower price than the Apple Store store. Be smart and save your money. The phone came with an Apple charger and cube. Did not include the headphones but NBD.",5
666,I bought this phone in 2018 and I still have it. It still works perfectly. I really like it the screen only came with small scratches but that’s all. The camera works so good. At first I thought it was going to be bad but it came perfectly fine so I say you buy it but if you don’t want to risk then don’t but I say yes it’s worth it. The phone will last maybe half a day or half depends how much you use it.,4
667,The phone looks pretty good supper minor damage phone works but certain parts of the screen goes dead or something sometimes it takes a while to type certain letters 🙄  And keep watching the video when I went into the calendar 😕 a whole bunch of weird msgs that where set up I’m scare to click them links idk if the phone has a virus or y’all put that there so many times bc you knew it had a virus.  I’m not sure,3
668,So far a awesome phone,5
669,Touch screen way too small did not activate phone,1
670,"Just received the phone, came earlier than expected. Even came with a few extra “goodies” from the shipper (Back case and front cover!).Looks brand new and MetroPCS was able to switch out my old Motorola G6 phone - all my contacts, photos, SIM card - everything into this phone. Now I need to learn how to use it!So far I am very impressed!I’ll update my review in 90 days.",5
671,"I bought this for Christmas for my daughter, phone came in excellent condition, no scratches. All I had to do was take out her sims card from her old phone and put it in the new phone and set it up. So far no issues with the phone, can hear great on phone calls.",5
672,"I bought this for my son. He is 16 and into gaming, streaming, watching movies and videos and he is more than happy with it's performance,  especially the storage capacity.  Phone is as advertised,  in like new condition, fully unlocked (we use Verizon) and functions as it should. Very pleased!",5
673,"Bought this for my 12 year old after his iPhone 6S died. I'm very impressed a week in. No blemishes, battery life is very good, and it was easy to transfer everything off his old phone by SIM card and iTunes.",5
674,"Got this iphone 8 as a replacement and it has no problems came with screen protector on it. And there was no problems setting it up, no cracks an actuall functioning phone. Love it",3
675,"This is the second refurbished phone I’ve bought. This one is very good. Great condition. It has a few very tiny scratches on the sides (which is why it didn’t get a 5), but once I put a phone cover on it, they aren’t that noticeable. Battery life is great. Keyboard and microphone great. Had no trouble transferring my information over. Great condition over all. Very happy with phone for the price.",4
676,UPDATE: 4 months after purchase and I've lost full touch functionality of the phone. Complete waste of money.quite disappointed this started to happen right around the 90 day mark. It was too late to return and now the touch functions are barely working. Wasted money. I gave 2 stars because the battery life is pretty good and doesn't lag.,2
677,"I'm still pleased. I wish my print was easier to scan. I still have to enter my pin less than 1/2 the time. You can't go wrong with 256GB. Leave your apps open and the battery goes down, what's new. Install the wrong app and it's even faster. So much info can move the battery for sure.",5
678,"so you can’t fully trust my review because i only bought one of these phones, but i bought one of these phones and the battery already seemed a little messed up, but everything else worked great. it actually arriving took exactly how long it said it would on amazon at first, don’t panic when it takes a little while. but everything else works good, a little laggy every now and then but everything else works good👍.",4
679,"I bought this phone for myself last year. It has held up, in pretty good condition, and works like a charm. The only downside to it is that I cannot turn my camera shutter sounds off. Everyone can hear if I’m taking a video, picture, voice recording, or screenshot for safety reasons. Other than that I am happy with my purchase. Hope that helps 😝",3
680,Exactly as described. I am a repeat buyer from Buyspry and I highly recommend as I have been very pleased with the products they provide. Phone was in great condition and already had a screen protector installed! Thanks for an easy purchase!,5
681,We were extremely disappointed and frustrated to find out recently that this phone was NOT free and clear when we bought from seller.  We tried to unlock from ATT as were we planning to switch to another carrier.  ATT could not unlock because they found out that the phone had not bee paid off by the party who sold or traded it to the seller of this product.  Will not buy from this seller AGAIN!,1
682,I have to replace the battery when in fact they knew the phone battery needs to be replaced the phone do not keep a charge.,1
683,"Is not only scratches, the paint is getting out.Very disappointed.",1
684,"when we tried to activate this unit with Verizon, we found unit had been locked on find my iPhone and could not be gotten into.  had to be returned.",1
685,Looks brand new.  Has 94% battery health.Great deal for a basically new phone.Thank youPS if u buy amazon renewed make sure the battery health is 80+ % as advertised.I got burned by a different vendor who expected me to go without a phone during the time it would take to ship the bad phone back & for them to send a new one.,5
686,"Great deal! The phone arrived very fast and in excellent condition. The listing said “good” condition and that it may have some minor scratches, etc. But it looks brand new, and works very well. It’s about 10 times faster and has much better battery life than the iPhone 6 that it replaced.",5
687,Shipping was very slow and late even though I asked seller for days to ship it. Phone is decent and works so far. Wireless charging doesn't work as it should.,2
688,"Find it funny that their fully unlocked phones are gsm and that they have gsm, unlocked models, too.it does everything a phone is supposed to do and trying to get the correct model is horrid",3
689,"I’ve personally purchased 4 different phones from Amazon over the last 4 years and have never had any problems with any of them. They always arrive in great condition and have worked like new to this day. And, this purchase follows suit. Perfect condition and works great!",5
690,"I got my phone today (iPhone 8, 64g) and was able to get my data, contacts, text messages, etc moved from my note 3 to my iPhone 8 without any problem  I’m giving a 5-star rating based on the condition of the phone which was excellent!  It came in mint condition! I’ll give another review based on battery performance.BATTERY REVIEW  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE this phone!!!!  It charges within about 3 hours and can go about a day and half on one charge. I do play games, shop, use the internet a lot plus quite a bit of texting throughout the day. Very happy with this phone!!",5
691,"I've had good and bad luck buying refurbs. In this case it appears the phone came with a bad battery. After a day it was dead. I would hope the refurb process included a new battery. One could waste a lot of time setting up a new phone, then going back to the old. A chance you take.",2
692,Good product just like brand new also very fast shipping,5
693,"El celular viene en perfecto estado, con cargador certificado, 100% de batería y sin roturas visibles.",5
694,It was in better condition than I expected. I've heard stories about refurbished phones on Amazon being all scratched up and dirty. This one at least was in great shape.,5
695,Apple asks you to verify account login with the phone number you originally started your iCloud account with and unfortunately for me that was about 4 numbers ago so I couldn’t gain access to my old purchases or pictures. But the device does its job. You’ll definitely have to take a trip to your mobile carrier to get the SIM activated (coming from android phone) good purchase.,5
696,"This iPhone was in great condition! All I did was turn off my old phone, switch SIM cards, turn the new phone on and bam! The iPhone did the rest- synced my iCloud, upgraded, let me set passwords.. within 20 minutes, my new phone was ready to use. The battery life is perfect. STRONGLY RECOMMEND.",5
697,"After reading some of the reviews on the reseller BUYSPRY I was actually terrified of buying this phone. Probably one of the riskiest clicks I've had to do.However, the phone arrived neatly packaged, exactly as advertised, with cable & wall charger and it looked brand new. There were a few light scratches on the screen and on the glass behind but the type of scratches that are only visible under certain angles and with lots of light - Personally not a problem at all. At first glance, it looks absolutely spotless - like a new phone. Battery capacity/health (the you can check at settings) was at 97% which seems pretty good. Overall, so far ZERO complaints. Phone looks amazing & works just as good.",5
698,Phone didn't work at all- it would shut off every 30-60 seconds.  I couldn't even set it up.,1
699,"Thank you for this phone. I ordered 2 phones for my twin daughters who live in Belton, Tx. I ordered this Red iPhone 8 from your company and it came in excellent working order. I ordered a Space Gray iPhone 8 from another company. I am still trying to figure out how to help my 15 year old daughter return the faulty phone from other company. Now thanks to you my daughters at least have 1 working phone. I hope I can return the faulty phone and order another phone from you.",5
700,This is the second phone I have replaced in our family lately and I am so happy I went with this seller again . Phone looks brand new and I am thrilled ! Thank you !,5
701,I love this upgrade to an 8 from a 6. The phone was delivered sooner then expected. The quality of the phone I’d have say is very close to new. the only thing I don’t like is the battery gets hot when playing a game but that otherwise I’m happy with my purchase.,5
702,This phone at very graphic pornography in favorites. The seller did not clean the phone! The phone was a gift for my 9 year old daughter who came across the disgusting porn. Her father and I are sooo disappointed in this product and the seller . The seller should be barred from selling on Amazon,1
703,"Bought this phone to replace my girlfriends iphone 7. Seemed to work ok at first but then we noticed that it hadnt been updated in years and was refusing to do so (her iphone seven was running on a newer ios then the 8) upon trying to update, the phone went into a restart loop and wouldnt even stay on for more than 20 seconds at a time. In the process of returning it and hopefully finding a fairly priced phone from a different seller that does work before the holidays. Would definitely NOT recommend",1
704,This was a Xmas gift for my daughter and MAN..if I didn't know better I'd think it was brand new. Mint condition. I highly recommend this seller and product,5
705,"Bought this for my grandma, and everything works perfectly! It came in amazing condition, no scratches or cracks. Runs very smoothly. The screen protector that came with it was also good. Maximum capacity for the battery is at 91%, which is nice. Great phone for a great price.",5
706,Great looking almost perfect finish with battery health at 85%. Use it as a iPod for walking around property as is lighter than my actual phone,5
707,Be careful. Even if you buy this phone you will NEVER be able to trade it in. Even with AT&T. Don’t be fooled and end up with. 300$+ paper weight.,1
708,the battery itself isn't bad but the phone keeps shutting off for no reason and freezing,1
709,The unit looked mostly new with mild scratches on the back panel.Everything worked sort except for one thing; the screen would during use intermittently go from idle to off to active mode in a cyclical pattern. I return.,1
710,"I was very disappointed when getting this phone. First of all, it says it is up to date but it had a very outdated software according to the Apple store and I couldn’t hear out of the speaker so I had to talk to everyone on speaker. I ultimately traded in my phone at the Apple store for $220 trade in value and got a new 8 plus instead. It sucks because I paid $370 for the phone and had it for less than a min so I was out $150. Buyer beware I would not recommend buying from this supplier.",1
711,Works great as advertised. Battery life not as good as new,5
712,Better than expected. Did not come with headphones!!!,4
713,"I like: that unlike my previous iPhone 6 that I can go all day on one charge, and also like the 256g of storage (I love to have movies ready for doctors visits).",5
714,"Phone came in really good physical condition. Only grip so early, only had phone a week, is that the battery life was at 79% not the 80% or above its supposed to be.  Not a huge deal, but worth noting.",4
715,"I bought this phone for my daughter and she’s very happy with it, it was in very good condition, not a single scratch. The setup was very easy and quick, touch screen works perfectly fine. I’m actually thinking about getting another one for my son.",5
716,"I found it hard to believe that this phone would be 100% worth it because it is refurbished, but after a couple of weeks of having this phone, it proved to be as efficient as it claims. I had a rough beginning with the phone but the company was so understanding and fixed my problem. The phone was in great condition when I received it! It was working just like a brand new phone would. The only problem is the battery life. Personally, the phone has great qualities but the battery life is not one.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase. You definitely get what you pay for.",4
717,"Arrived fast,very good condition and I use it with my refurbished apple watch. I got this for my daughter at Christmas and it's still working great.",4
718,"Everything good on this phone except the microphone isn't working; have tried multiple things to fix, nothing working. When someone calls, I can hear them, but they can't hear me.",2
719,"Turned on phone and it started updating. Somewhere in the process the phone stoped working. I try to restart, recharge nothing but a dead phone ( Disappointed ). I had to return phone and pay shipping fee ( ridiculous ). Dissatisfied with product and return policy. Company provided return shipping label when printed should be postage paid. When I payed once to have product sent to me.",1
720,When I got the phone it honestly looked pretty new to me. No scratches or dents. Everything worked perfectly fine. It came with a charger cable and box.,5
721,I love the color it’s like a rose gold. Easy to use. Easy to transfer my information from my old phone. The only problem I have is when it’s turned completely off I have to plug it in to restart it,5
722,I ordered this product and it says “fully unlocked” and it had an activation lock on it. It had the previous owners iCloud account still on it so I couldn’t do anything with the phone. Returned the phone and requested a refund due to the fact they lied about it being unlocked!!,1
723,After three tries I finally got an I phone 8 that works ax it’s should out ic the gate I’ll let you know I. 6 mo but so far excellent btw a mason is just so good at making it rightThank you amazon,5
724,Bought the phone for some trade in value but it came with a chip in the frame and wasn’t worth what it could have been. Phone seemed to function otherwise.,3
725,I purchased this for my son's birthday and there is air bubbles under the screen which makes it harder to press the screen.  I bought 3 different phone cases because the other 2 did not fit correctly because of the way the phone screen is improperly put on. I called customer service and was told I will receive a phone call from the seller but never did. I'm highly irritated because this was a gift.,1
726,"Bought it on Oct. 26, today is Feb. 13 and the battery is already draining in about an hour. I am 2 weeks beyond the 30-day return policy. Not good.",2
727,I bought this phone as it is unlocked but then I went to put my SIM card in and it said that it was locked. Don’t buy from this seller,1
728,"Not satisfied with the battery capacity, arrived with 80% life remaining. Also took 12 days before it was able to receive texts from android device. Carrier claims they did nothing to rectify, not sure I believe them. Condition of the phone is excellent, other than the battery.",4
729,Every time this phone is in the sun it says it’s overheating and I am not able to use the phone when this happens. The flashlight is broken. Doesn’t give the option to even turn on which is an inconvenience. I used to use flashlight often on every iPhone I’ve had. I deduct one start each for these major inconveniences,3
730,It had scratches on the phone . But it was my daughters birthday present . Did not feel like returning it . The charging port and cable were not Apple. But I think it mentioned that . The phone was just inside the box . No wrapping whatsoever. Phone is good I guesS overall,3
731,The renewed phone I got only had 84% battery health. It's only a few % better than my old phone that I used for a couple of years. Want to see what others got.,3
732,"I was worried, but the phone arrived in excellent scratch free condition. The battery life is fine after using for a few weeks. Does not come with a SIM card.",5
733,Awesome how you can get a great phone for cheap here. I took off one star because the was a small Nick on one of the edges but otherwise it looked pretty good.,4
734,The phone proximity sensor and camera didn’t work right. No problem with return so gave them a 3 star for easy return or it would have been 1 star.,3
735,this thing came more broken than my spirit,1
736,i shouldve bought insurance.  I just didnt think the phone would break in 3 months.  now the kid has to use aiphone 6 borrowed from a family member.  you get what you pay for.,2
737,The phone model number did not translate to the new battery number required. I had to go through a third party to obtain the new battery.,4
738,"This was an awful experience. The seller wants to charge a 15% restocking fee for a phone that arrived with a ""degraded condition"" battery that ""is in need of service"" and has a max capacity of 74%. I returned it the day I got it but there should not be a 15% restocking fee!",1
739,After I received the phone I checked the serial number and this phone is originally for Japan. However it works fine and my son loves it,4
740,"The phone works great, but on the left side of the screen it never goes completely black. There are light streaks on the side of the screen.",3
741,El equipo no estaba desbloqueado. Apenas lo recibí coloqué mi SIM (T Mobile) y no funcionaba . Preocupado hice pruebas con SIMS de otras operadoras y el único que funcionó  fue AT&T. Llevé el aparato a una tienda Apple y a T Mobile y me explicaron que la única razón por la que no leía mi información era porque no estaba liberado.Mi mayor molestia fue que al recibir el reembolso de mi dinero me descontaron 30 dolares. No puedo estar de acuerdo con eso! Me venden un equipo que no funciona y además me descuentan dinero.Espero que esta pésima experiencia sirva para tomar correctivos y mejorar su costumer service .,1
742,Like very much thank youCan’t seem to get new credit card installedYet very pleased with the quality andFunctionality of this phone,5
743,Arrived in good physical condition with no visible damage or scratches. Everything seems to function properly. Only complaint I have is that the battery is down to 82% capacity. Apple recommends replacing the battery at 80% which means the $182 price tag is click bait. This phone will cost me $100 more to keep.,3
744,"Overall the phone was great physically. He battery was 83% upon arrival and stated ""service"" b7t my dad was still super happy with it. No biggie I've changed many iphone batteries in the past. Everything else is 100% great and functional.",5
745,"I've had bad experiences purchasing phones off Amazon over the years. However, recently they've been doing a bang up job sending me fully working products. I don't know if I'm lucky or they upped their standards. Whatever the case maybe, I got the package a whopping two days early and the setup was business as usual. Would recommend.Other Key Features - It comes with an iPhone charger and Push Pin for the SIM card slot.P. S. I am a T-Mobile user.",5
746,"The phone me in great condition, but I found an issue with the call volume. Turns out a some iPhones could have this issue where the call volume is extremely quiet and can't be raised. The seller accepted the phone back and gave a full refund",5
747,Came early and works well. The condition was good not pristine but good. A few small blemishes here and there. Works well and I would recommend.,4
748,"Based on reviews I've read, it seems that refurbished phones are hit and miss. And that makes sense: not all used phones were treated equally.Our experience with this Renewed iPhone 8 has been GREAT.  The phone really is in excellent condition. Works like new, looks almost new, but costs half the price. Battery came with 93% battery life, which is still an 'A' in my book.I'd recommend giving it a try. We are very satisfied with the phone.",5
749,"This phone came looking and performing as a new item. Very pleased with it. It took a week to get it, but still reasonable time. The price was fantastic, less than $200 including delivery.",4
750,"So far I’m happy with my new iPhone 8, with one exception: it came with a non-compatible charger. How am I supposed to charge up a brand new phone with the wrong charger? Good thing I had my existing iPhone 6 charger. My point is, if they say they’re going to send you a compatible charger, then send one! Then I found out the hard way that my Sim card in my iPhone 6 is not compatible with my iPhone 8, and this phone did not come with a Sim card. I suggest you read the product description thoroughly before you decide to purchase!",3
751,Compre este teléfono para usar en Uruguay con Movistar hace 1 mes aproximadamente.El teléfono está como nuevo sin detalles totalmente desbloqueado.La batería anda perfecto.Trajo como dice la publicación el cargador no original.Me lleve la sorpresa de q no tiene para colocar audífonos tradicionales por lo que compre unos inalámbricos con BT.Muy satisfecho y súper recomendable por el precio.Espero siga así.Muy buena compra.,5
752,"My first iPhone so far, I've been wanting to buy these for a long time to see what all the rage is about iphones and I like it alot so far, really clean practically brand new no scratches or dents at all and I love the color and vibrant white",5
753,"Refurbs are tough i guess.I purchased with already having fear of rerubs, what i received cemented that fear for me.Unlike some refurbs that i have gotten in the past the hardware seemed to be in full working order.  But one of the phone looked like it was bathed in an apricot puree (or fecal matter, i prefer to hope it was apricot) then lightly wiped down (leaving TONS of gross still).",1
754,"Used. Phone was great. Came out the box (Silent/ Vibrate Switch) was broken. Went into silent mode on and off automatically when ever it wanted to all by itself. Missed calls, messages, facetime without even knowing while Still in my Pocket until I checked it when I had free time while at work or out. Only had it for a Week and a Half then Sold it to somebody else. Just bought an iphone 11 yesterday instead.",3
755,Item was not good,1
756,"The renewed iPhone 8 arrived with no visible scratches, dents or blemishes.  The battery life is excellent and every button and feature is in perfect working condition.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Now I have retroactive buyer's remorse:  I wish I had bought my *last* phone as an Amazon Renewed product.",5
757,"Phone almost looked new when it came, phenomenal quality, 85% battery life. Overall amazing quality.Be warned, these phones are sometimes manufactured in Japan, and therefore the camera shutter sound never turns off when taking a picture, ever. Makes it annoying in public, and is a bit of a downside.",4
758,When I receive it this speaker is crackling when you have it on speaker when it’s not on speaker you can barely hear anybody talk why it’s making funny sounds like the speaker is busted not very happy with the money I spent,1
759,"I really like returning to the old school look with the home button.  Also, I like the small size. The phone was in perfect shape!  The battery does ok for being an older model and smaller phone.",5
760,"Camera works Great too. Just pop in my sim card, worked like a charm, Its the third phone I buy from same place, have not had any problems. I bought three phones for the whole family, Highly Recommend Buying if you don't want to spend a whole lot of money.  My wife uses it to make short videos.",5
761,No quite satisfied had to pay to unlock the phone which wasn’t cheap and I thought the phone was already unlock and it says to all carrier,1
762,"I bought two.... one was Unlocked, the other was not. Sent them abroad as gifts 🎁 and when tried connecting.... well ... one was not unlocked! They offered for me to return it and refund the money... only thing is... I was charged around $ 150.00 if I wanted to ship it back ( if I wanted to return it I had to bring it back ). They offered to cover $25.00, well, buy it to use only in the US. 50% chances it is not unlocked. Had to pay $ 200.00 additional to have unlocked",1
763,"Arrived in a Verizon box which threw me since I didn’t order it from Verizon & I’m on at&t, so I wasn’t even sure if it was going to be fully unlocked for at&t. Not happy with the confusion but the product is fine and it works.",4
764,"I got it fine and safe but then after using it for few months it started not showing apps, the name of the apps, and even not turning on. One day it couldn’t turn on at all and I tried everything possible, charging it, resetting it, but nothing worked. This phone lasted for 4 months, I don’t recommend it if you are trying to get a phone that will last for a long period of time.",2
765,"Iphone is my third or fourth iPhone.  Previous phones worked until they simply quit.This phone requires sim card which the online videos plainly show HOW to install --unfortunately, Amazon web site did NOT mention that a sim card and phoneservice was required for phone to work.  So I spent Labor Day weekend withouta working phone.  Shame on Amazon for not mentioning this.  If I had known,could have had sim card home waiting for iPhone to arrive and iPhone did arriveon time.",4
766,Works really super. Looks brand new and works the same as brand new. No problems getting it setup and iwatch connected smoothly.,5
767,this is a used iphone。everythings is ok，but bettery life down to only 80%。i have to renew a new one later and i throw away charge adapter to trash can。,2
768,"This phone works great refurbished, the only complaint is the battery life (only 80% max left after its original use). But all things considered, this phone was a fantastic value, works great, and I can deal with needing to charge it once a day. Probably still cheaper to replace the battery than try to buy the same phone brand new.",4
769,"Super fast delivery ordered on Wednesday received phone on Thursday. iPhone 8 with minor wear to the device, fully operational battery, fully functional phone. Extremely satisfied with the phone provided.👍🏽👍🏽",5
770,Believe this phone came from overseas because the camera shutter sound will not mute even with the silent switch on. Called Apple and they told me overseas phones have this feature that is not controlled.The battery life is at 82%. The cosmetic of the phone is outstanding and the phone did come in a apple box. Daughter can't get passed the shutter sound and battery life so we will are returning.,4
771,We had to return this IPhone8. We were excited for the purchase but within a week the touch bad was failing miserably.  Had to purchase an alternate phone from a different vendor.,1
772,Standard iPhone 8 working great only thing it came in a box that said mobile device phone on it total knock off really cheesy and the headphones and charging stuff was gone it was also very clear that it was refurbished,4
773,Ok,4
774,"This phone was a ""renewed"" phone but you couldn't tell. There were absolutely no signs of use anywhere on the phone. No scratches, no issues with the screen. All buttons and all functions work perfectly. No complaints whatsoever!",5
775,"I expected so much more from Apple. This is my 2nd IPhone and I thought it would be so much better. Part of the screen reacts to touch sometimes and most of the time not. It takes quite a while to load apps and internet and the battery isn’t the best either. Everyone speaks so highly of these phones, but I am not convinced. I am going back to Samsung as soon as possible. 😕",2
776,It came in perfect condition and just as described!! Got this for my daughter’s birthday in May and she has been using it ever since with no issue. Took about a week to ship but it came as scheduled. Very pleased and would buy again!!,5
777,"I just got the iphone 8 (renewed) fully unlocked delivered. I was initially happy as the phone was in great condition. Data transfer from old iphone went off without a hitch! The Sim card from my old iphone even worked! Unfortunately, that was as good as it got, and after using the phone for just a few minutes I realized there were big problems!This iphone 8 (renewed) would just inexplicably power down when my fingers were interacting with the screen. The so called 'inspection' of this phone was performed poorly. Very disappointed!",1
778,Great buy!! I bought this for my 12 year old for getting straight As...It had a tiny scratch on the screen in the upper corner but definitely not too noticeable!! So far works great and moves quickly!!! I’ll be back for another once my other son gets his F up to an A or B lol,5
779,"Super happy with the purchase. Battery health came at 95% which is well above the guaranteed 80%. No scratches on the exterior of the phone, and there is a screen protector still attached which is actually pretty nice as I am waiting for my blue light screen protector to arrive and I don’t have to worry until then. Super happy it came with a SIM card remover so I didn’t have to go into the store to get it changed out. Great price, no glitches so far. All around happy!",5
780,"The phone would not activate so I contacted my carriers tech support. They attempted and told me it was locked! I took it the the local carrier store the next day and they attempted to activate. After entering the phones I.D. info, they said the phone was ""blackmailed from their system"", I ask what would cause that and they said the phone had problem been stolen and disabled! I don't need this fustration!! Your call though.",1
781,"The phone was refurbished, it came looking brand new & even had a screen protector. I’ve been a Samsung user from the get go of cellphones and still getting used to iPhone. The one feature I really don’t like abut iPhone is the keyboard & having to keep switching back and forth. Oh well can’t have everything I guess. I would recommend the seller highly.",5
782,Received as promised. I could not find any blemish. Bought this for my wife and she is very happy with it. Looks and works just like a new phone. I will definitely buy again from this seller when its time for next upgrade.,5
783,Junk worse phone ever no way sellers didn’t know it was junk. By the time I loaded and new service when I found out. I limped through to find better phone. Do not buy from them,1
784,"This phone is only worth the $170 I paid for it. Meaning, you get what you pay for. The speaker for both input and output are horrible, no one can hear me and I can’t hear them. Also drops calls repeatedly. Will be returning if possible. Oh and battery health is only 83%, it seems to be holding a charge fine but 83% health is pretty bad. Amazon needs to do a little more testing before they start sending out these refurbished phones.",2
785,"Product had no visible damage. It works well— sound, camera, touch screen, etc. I was worried seeing some other reviews, but I am happy with the product.",5
786,The phone had no scratches or defects and it even came with a screen protector. We put the SIM card in and it all worked perfectly. I used to purchase my used phones from a different website and things just didn’t run as smoothly with that website.The price on Amazon was way better and the phone was perfect! I will always purchase from here from now on.,5
787,"Overall, this phone has been exactly what I expected.  Everything functions well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the screen had a few minor scratches  and the battery maximum capacity only reaches 82%.  I know these are all things within the expectations of a refurbished phone, but for the hundreds of dollars I spent, it's still a little disappointing hence 4 stars not 5.  Overall, though, I'm very satisfied.",4
788,"Phone came in impeccable condition! As of now I have no complaints. Everything seem to be working. (Cameras, mics, buttons, speakers) will update if anything changes.3week update: phone is absolutely amazing I haven’t experienced not a single issue. If I could give a grade on my new phone I’d give it an A+!!!",5
789,One small ding but otherwise great phone for the price. Would buy from this seller again,4
790,"This phone was exactly what I needed. Clean IMEI, unlocked, and untied to the previous owner’s Apple ID. There were some wear and tear on the screen and the edges. And the battery was at 82% capacity left. However, for the price I can’t complain.",5
791,"I purchased this phone for my son. He loves it, I’m glad I was able to find it. I thought it was a good price too! This phone doesn’t have facial recognition, but that’s ok.",5
792,"Received the information iPhone everything is in new condition except for the battery. It says it needs to be replaced. Which they said it would be no problem to give me a refund except that means waiting for them to receive my phone to issue the refund, then the wait for it to clear my account, then buy new phone and wait for it to come in..all while not having a phone period. JUST A HASSLE!",1
793,"I was hesitant to go with a “renewed” product, but I needed more memory capacity and really didn’t want to spend a fortune on a new phone. I received this one in like new condition, it works great, and I am very pleased!",5
794,5,5
795,"UPDATE: Requested refund, it was approved, sent the locked phone back and now NOTHING! It's been 3 months... do NOT but grin this seller.Took it to be activated and it's LOCKED because of a previous bill!!! So pretty much useless.",1
796,I always buy a refurbished phone on amazon every 2 years. I’ve had great success with this. I bought this one 2 months ago or so and a week or 2 ago it was shutting down while on a FaceTime call multiple times. Then today it just shut down again. It seems like the home button gets stuck/doesn’t read a fingerprint or me pushing on it when it shuts down. Super disappointed in this $300 purchase that’s already having problems🙄 Shop somewhere else.,2
797,This phone works great and came on time. There is one small crack on the side of the screen but I hardly notice it and the product description explained there could be small imperfections. Great product for the price I paid.,5
798,as expected!,5
799,I’ve had the phone for two weeks without any issue. The phone and the accessories came neatly packaged; phone included a temporary protective cover. Front and rear glass appear to be new.  The only cosmetic flaws are a few scuffs on the metal bezel. I would consider that to be expected for a used phone. Not a big deal for the flaws are unseen once the phone is in a case. I would definitely buy again when my wife or I are in store for a better phone.,5
800,"I returned it because I'm used to the size of an iPhone 7 plus, but the phone was flawless. It even came with the sticker on the screen, like it was brand new. The packaging left nothing to be desired, it was 256GB as advertised and gave no problems. I just forgot to notice that it was an 8 and not an 8 plus, but that's on me. The product still deserves five stars.",5
801,Everything is good except the battery evaluation was at 83% right out of the box.  Renewed should be 100% chargeable.,3
802,This phone was shipped and received on time. The condition is great. However the phone does not hold a battery charge for more than 3 hours without recharging it. Would not buy from this company again.,2
803,The phone had a glitch as to whenever the brightness was turned up the screen would flicker. Returned it for a refund.,1
804,Purchased this product for getting a lower costing purchase price on a like new iPhone. So far been very happy with it however have found one glitch that is a nuisance but not a deal breaker. On my particular iPhone the volume up and down buttons do not seem to work. For me this isn’t a big deal as I use speakerphone 99% of the time anyway so adjusting the volume is easily accessed through the control center on the phone.,4
805,"The phone I received was not working and it would consistently shut down randomly and then after a few days it shut down completely and won’t turn on. Honestly if you can’t even keep a product functional, don’t bother selling it. I’ve lost so much on this, what do you expect me to do now? We even showed it to a phone repair company and they said that all the batteries were working but they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with it although it’s functions seem to be fine.",1
806,We haven't had any problems with this phone. It looks and works great. Had an old phone and needed more memory. Shipment was quick and well packaged.,5
807,I brought total three this iphone8 to do iPhone 12 family plan trade in promotion. All three phone are looks new and also very good quality. The trade in process is very smooth and has no problem. Highly recommended!,5
808,"It's beautiful and perfectly functioning.  I didn't even go to my carrier, just  put my SIM card inside and it goes.",5
809,The phone was in good condition. The sim card door broke but they sent me a new one. Phone seems to be operating fine. Would purchase from this seller again when I need to.,5
810,I bought this phone and was super easy to set up and super cheap!!! Plus the color vibrancy is amazing!!!! Never going back to cell phone stores to get an expensive phone that’s just going to glitch!!!!,5
811,"Despite it is sold refurbished I attest it came in high quality. The battery, which is always my main concern, lasts almost as new.",5
812,What I liked was that it was pretty cheap everything was great and the battery life lasted me 8-10 hours I went to screen time and it seid 10 hours and then 5 becouse when I first got it I was in it a lot then I slowed down I love everything about it but I’m about 6 months to a year I’m prolly gong to get a new battery but I switched from the 5s and the 8 is so much better,5
813,"I got this for my wife. We have always had Android phones, so the setup and apps are way different. The screen size was the real issue I returned the phone.",3
814,This is the Third back up phone I've purchased. The 8 in iPhone is my favorite secondary phone. Excellent purchase.,5
815,Charging cable sent with phone obviously wasn't for that Iphone because it wouldn't even charge it!! The only way it charged was when it was on a charging pad! Also sim tool was way too big to open door for removal of Sim card so had to use an earring. With that being said all I want is a R.E.F.U.N.D!!!,1
816,"I was so nervous about ordering a refurbished iPhone off Amazon but this was worth the money! I've had the phone for about a week now and I have no complaints. Cosmetically, there were a few scratches by the power button and on the lower left portion of the screen but I put on a case and glass screen protector so you can't even see the scratches anymore. My phone came with 90% battery health remaining. My T-mobile sim card booted up just fine and I had no issues with creating getting the phone set up. Would recommend!",5
817,This little baby came in excellent condition.  The phone looks brand new!!! Loop mobile!!! yess!!!  I really like this phone!!!,5
818,If you do not have Tech skills or trouble following instructions....be prepared to send Another 40$ to have it set up. If your an Android person...be prepared for some headaches getting to know the iOS.,4
819,"I was a little hesitant to buy a refurbished phone,  my daughter has had it for 3 months no problems at all. Everything was as described. Saved me a lot of $$$$",5
820,"I wrongly believed this iphone was defective & wrote a negative review.  Due to the corona virus our AT&T store was closed, the fact that I’d already received a horribly defective phone FROM ANOTHER COMPANY, and my total lack of knowledge about new iPhone technology all lead to this wrong conclusion.  Cellcow staff were very courteous & promptly shipped me another phone.  I want to apologize for my previous rant review.  There is nothing wrong with either phone!  I will keep one & return the other.",5
821,Ok. Only the battery,5
822,Works great for my daughter. We haven’t tried hooking her up to cell service yet. She has it for texting and FaceTime. So far works great,5
823,"I got this for my 11 years old daughter.  It was her first purchase  with her own money.  So we were a bit  concerned  since the product  was renewed.  If we didn't know it was renewed  we couldn't  say. Looks like a brand new. I didn't  see any cosmetic detail.So far, everything  is working  perfectly and she is very happy.",5
824,I am very satisfied with this Purchase.Great price for 256 GB I phone !  It works very well screen is brilliant all the features work great !Today was the third day and battery life was better than my older I phone. Need to charge it after 2 days.,5
825,The phone can barely hold a charge and there are major nicks on the metal casing all over the phone.... not what I expected for 260 dollars,1
826,This is a replacement phone for grandaughter. Great looking and economical. Grandaughter has not had any complaints.,5
827,The fingerprint reader was a little buggy I kept holding my finger down on the lol screen and somtimes it worked some times it didn't,5
828,Sounds like you are in a cave. Microphone must have been damaged. Do not recommend this seller.,1
829,"Just activated this new iPhone a few weeks ago as I waited to switch carriers and it’s been a great buy, I’m still getting use to the size as I had a 6+ before. All in all this has been great I should have got this months ago.",5
830,It was in perfect condition. Works perfectly. All features work. Battery life is great. Fingerprint works great. Absolutely no problems. I connected my phone to Metro.,5
831,I love my iPhone 8!!!! It’s beautiful super clean and pristine!!!! 100% battery life and no scratches!!!! Sometimes the volume seems a little low in phone calls but it works perfectly!!!! I was hesitant after reading some reviews on here but it was a great buy I’m so happy with this phone!!!! I hope everyone gets as lucky as me!!!! I hope this helps anyone that’s worried about buying and it was UNLOCKED completely and I have Metro PCs and I got my Android switched over right away!!!!!! This is a real review no BS🙅🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️,5
832,Iphone was exactly what I wanted. Great condition. Great price. Works great. Love it! Even arrived earlier than expected!,5
833,The iPhone looked okay at first after about a month i noticed the bottom two screw near the charging port we’re Missing upon further investigation I concluded that the screw holes attached to the face glass we’re missing so the screws had nothing to screw into so basically I’m screwed,3
834,"The phone works great, it was dirty when I received it, I had to thoroughly clean it before I could set it up to use!",5
835,We bought this used Iphone 8 about 1 year ago and it is still working fine.  The battery was good and still is.  I would recomment.,5
836,So far I have had no issues with the phone. It works great. The battery level is good and it looks like new.,5
837,"I had a couple of other iPhones where I really noticed the battery either having a very short working life or actually swelling and pushing out the front face of the phone, I can safely say that I am happy not to have noticed if this phone's battery life is just ""good enough"" or actually ""great!""",5
838,Delivered a day early and came as described.  The phone I received was in like new condition.  I slipped in my sim card and the phone started to work as soon as I turned it back on.  I am very pleased with my purchase.,5
839,I got this almost 4 months ago. So far it’s performing good. Just the battery came at 80% of its capacity. Apart from that it’s a pretty good deal for a refurbished iPhone. Recommended.,5
840,"We can't use the phone, it's marked as stolen. We try to contact the seller from the Ask a question and their link doesn't work.",1
841,"Seemed like a great deal, battery life was only around 80% but we just dealt with that. Then 2 months outside of Amazons 90 day warranty period the phone just dies and will not charge anymore. Now the Phone only works for 5 minutes unless connected to a charging cable, which makes it useless without a new battery. Obvious battery issue. I should have requested a replacement when I noticed the lower than expected battery life.",2
842,"The logic board is faulty and calls would cut off. The Apple store would not repair it, and we learned about the problem outside the return window due to Covid delays. Now the screen stopped working entirely. It's just a black screen.Now we can't return the product--short of $241. Poor service from the company as well as Amazon. If the seller is reading, please allow us to return!",1
843,"The battery will have to be replaced soon and I just got the phone 10 days ago.  It will not make it through 1.5 days without a charge. I am older than 50 and do not use my phone that much so it’s not my usage.  When checking the settings, it says battery is very degraded.  Will not ever buy a renewed phone through Amazon.  By the time I replace the battery,  I have the same $$ wrapped up in the phone if I had just bought a new one.",2
844,"I bought this phone for my mom who was maxing out her storage on her iPhone 6. The phone works fine (a lot better then an 6). The charger provided in the box didn’t work and the screen wasn’t completely flush with the case but that isn’t a problem. The phone also had a couple of dirt marks on it but after a wipe they can right off. Additionally, the phone said that the battery health was at 100%. Overall I would recommend this phone and there was no major problems.",4
845,"Well I’m aware this is a refurbished phone so I can’t expect it to be a great device. The battery life is 83%, a little scratch on the display and the only thing I dislike is that the True Tone is damaged/not available, apparently this device display has been fixed before but the True Tone remained damaged.",4
846,"Excellent quality, as good as new",5
847,"It’s a ripoff . I bought it as a Christmas present , it is NOT 256 GB it is a 64 ( and announced as 256) it is Verizon not factory unlocked , and it’s worthless . They ruined what was supposed to be a thoughtful gift",1
848,"Phone in good condition, had no problems getting the phone to work with ATT card.  Looking forward to using all the new features of this phone.  Good delivery and was better product than expected.",5
849,If I could give this product a zero I would. Ordered this phone once and the front camera didn't work. Decided to return it and replace it with another phone from this same vendor. BIG mistake-- the second phone's front camera doesn't work either! Clearly they do not quality check their products before they send them out. Don't waste your time and money!,1
850,"Its honestly a great phone, and it works well. Everything about it is fine, it still has 89% battery capacity, the cameras are great, its very fast. The only problem is that when I got it the phone was still locked onto another carrier. My carrier is Metro PCS and they told me that I would have to talk to the seller and get them to actually unlock the phone because it's still locked onto another account. This is very frustrating. Hopefully I can return the phone and actually get it unlocked soon.",3
851,"The phone came as promised. Externally it looked good, and after updating the software it accepted my SIM card with no problems. The screen protected it came with cracked within the first day of use. The battery had a maximum capacity of 85%, which was expected. However, the phone does discharge when being used very quickly. It can go from full to empty in only 2 hours. Very good quality for the price, except for the battery life.",4
852,Worse place to get a phone. After the phone didn’t work and returned it. They still won’t return the money. If you can buy from someone else,1
853,"This iphone has great features good screen sensitivity, even case on. Great battery life it came well protected and in mint condition. I’ll follow with an update. Right now just getting started.",5
854,"Since I was replacing my iphone 7 with this 8, I was already very familliar.  The new phone didn't rock my world, and I didn't expect it too, that is not what this purchase was about. This new phone came to replace about the exact phone and it did exactly that. Painless transfer of contacts, photos and apps and being able to go to the office the next day with a new phone ready with no hiccups. Good purchase.",5
855,Thank you so much for a quality product for good value. My original phone died during this pandemic and it is crucial to have some way to stay in touch during this time. You saved my world.,5
856,It will be good but the camera was super burry and you couldn’t  see nothing and it was bad but every thing else work wonders I was using it about a week untilI had to use the camera and I show it was burry and I was like it probably dirty then I clean it and nothing it probably the case I took it off and nothing. I thought it because I was trying to take a picture of my laptop of a information but then I took a picture of a paper and it was also bad. Every thing else works good .,4
857,"This is my upgrade from a Samsung J3. OMG, the camera is AWESOME! Battery lasts longer & it's super FAST. I had to buy an iphone to conform to my provider, Virgin Mobile - I  didn't want to change providers and lose my number (like my wife did). Just can't beat $35/mo from VM.",5
858,"Don’t buy, not worth it. Screen will crack, no matter what you put on it. Battery life is about 25% less then what it should be.",1
859,"Best refurbish phone; every features of the phone works well. Fully unlocked phone, no problems so far.",5
860,"Bought this phone to replace an older Android due to purchasing the Apple Watch.  Still in a learning curve, about the settings.  I did not receive an instruction manual and the ones online are not too helpful.  However, my biggest concern is the battery seems to drain rather quickly -- maybe this is quirk with all Apple phones?  Overall, I am pleased with the phone.",5
861,"Ad clearly states FULLY unlocked and after corresponding with Breed, it is not. Said the ad was wrong and they would contact Amazon to fix it or take it down. Very disappointed as we already paid for it, and ordered a case and screen protector. Now have to go through the hassle of returning. Bait and switch in my opinion!",1
862,"Aesthetically the cell phone was in good condition, I left it charging until It reached 100% I turned it on to set it up, in that process the cell phone felt very hot. Within two hours of lasting the battery low from 100 to 58%, I went to sleep and the next day the cell phone dawned with 8% without using it. I bought this from seller BuySPRY. He's been trying to call them, but I haven't been able to communicate, so I requested a refund through Amazon.",2
863,"I just got this phone today. The battery is supposed to be higher than 80% (which is already pretty crappy to be honest) and my battery is only 78%, which is bad.... It’s advertised 80% or above... So why isn’t mine 80% or above?",3
864,Like price disliked the size,5
865,"Looks and works just like a new one.Except the battery, but that was expectable for the smartphone made more than 3 years ago.Got it a good discount, it came in generic box with charger, cable and a pin.Unlocked, as it was claimed.So, I'm glad for  purchasing it.Got exactly wanted to, and with good price.",5
866,We got this refurbished phone for our teen daughter at Christmas.  It came as promised and looks brand new.  Easy to install the SIM card and activate.  Definitely a better value than buying a new phone.,5
867,"I like it very much! Looks perfect! I Bought  it for my son and hope it will last . Yes all seams perfect including finger print reader, face recognition and battery life. It’s only been 6 days but so far so very good.",5
868,Company is easy to work with. Phone is in great condition. Would definitely purchase from them again!,5
869,"I literally bought this phone in august for nearly $400 and it would randomly shut off and i didn’t think anything of it, but after the 14.3 update it revealed that I have broken hardware. For 400 dollars I was definitely expecting a phone with zero issues I’m going into the Apple store to hopefully get it fixed tomorrow, if they can’t fix it I’m hoping I can return it.",1
870,"The phone arrived not charged and after 30 minutes of charging had 3% life and nothing would work on the phone.  After getting in-person help from my carrier Cricket, they confirmed that it doesn't work and i need to return it.  Unfortunately , then I had to pay $6 to return it because Amazon requests you print the label and box yourself.",1
871,High quality used iPhone 8! Battery life is good and love that the size is the same as my IPhone 6S.,5
872,"Exelente condiciones,  muy buen teléfono feliz 😀",5
873,"Senior citizen. Employer requested upgrade. Technologically challenged. Didn't need bells, whistles, apps. Felt  used/refurbished would be acceptable. Son assisted with product selection. Apple iPhone 8 functionality good, battery recharging frequent, conversations interrupted/broken up, reception lost/disconnected. Request refund. Will probably purchase brand new now. Thank you.",4
874,"Phone was in great shape with no cracks or damage upon inspection and shipping was very swift, however, battery condition was at require service-""recommend replacement"".  Maximum charge 82%. Battery goes down very quickly.",3
875,I like the reliability of the Apple cell phone - the fingerprint reader is a time saver and is safer than passwords- battery life so for good,5
876,"This phone looked like new and works great.  Good battery life, all functions work and updates automatically with no issues.",5
877,"Coming from a person that owned an iPhone 6 for almost 3 years, this phone is an absolute unit. I love it’s interface, the remarkable speed, and the impeccable battery life. I expected this phone to come with a scratch or two or at least an 80% battery life but it came with zero scratches and a 100% battery life. Definitely worth the purchase. It also came with a pin to manually switch over my SIM card from my old phone to this one. Fully unlocked already as well.",5
878,"I love my new iPhone. It’s refurbished but it’s new to me.  I set it up myself, really easy. It said no sim, asked my do I need to put it in new phone. He told me to google it.  I was smart enough to fight out, when I called number and old phone rang. I figured it out.",5
879,Very happy with shipping speed. Phone works great just like new! Will definitely be doing business with them again in the future!,5
880,Worked 9 months before the bottom half of screen wouldn’t respond. No response by seller on email. STAY AWAY FROM REFURBS!!!,2
881,It says in brand new sealed box but wasn’t. It was like a generic no brand cell phone prepaid cheap cellphone box. NOT BRAND NEW at all. It was setup and had scratches on the screen. Looked good sure but not brand new in a sealed box like they claim.,2
882,"there some dirty at the bottom of iphone (microphone and plug).the charger is not originalthe battery is fast to useI bought a refurbished one two years ago which is high quality, but this one is disappointed to me greatly.I will no longer buy it from amazon.",1
883,"The applications in the phone freeze sometimes. When it happens that way, I always turn it off and turn it on before they start working. Also the home button is a bit displaced right from the day it was delivered. It makes some displaced sound when I use it. I am thinking of returning it to get iPhone 11.",1
884,"Battery life excellent, one smal gap in lens shield, reception fine.  No visible scratches or dents",5
885,Bien,5
886,The phone was fine at first and a week or so later there were issues with the sound.  I think this can happen when you get a refurbished phone.  We returned it with no issues.,3
887,Overall is great just like new except for one issue: Mail App somehow still shows as the previous user's name or initial when I lightly tapped on “Mail” app icon. It prevents me wanting to use “Mail” app. Can someone give me instructions on how to fix this? Thanks!,4
888,"Excellent condition, like new. Arrived promptly Everything works apart from fingerprint function but I had the same problem with my last one. Maybe I just don’t have good enough fingerprints.",5
889,"Received the phone late, found out it had a bad battery and a bad screen. I had to replace the battery out of my pocket because the company that has the phones stated it’s up to Amazon to repair the phone and Amazon said it was up to the company to do the repairs. In other words too bad we don’t care as long as we have your money.",2
890,I will admit that I was a little skeptical about buying a iPhone from amazon. But it was the best decision I could have made! I was very impressed with the “newness” of the phone! Everything works perfectly and they also threw in a free tempered glass.,5
891,There is no facial recognition in the edition but it works perfectly. They give you a screen protector already on the phone and it is in mint condition. I highly recommend.,5
892,Picked up a phone that would support wi-fi calling. This was in as new condition and a very good value,5
893,I would like to say I bought this phone and It worked great at first. I used it for 3 days then I plugged It into the charger like normal I come back and it won't turn on. Keep in mind I did not do anything drastic to this phone before. Then after a while It randomly turns on then works for 2 minutes and shuts off. I am currently trying to get it fixed. I would recommend saving up for a new phone.,2
894,"Purchased this for my husband who has a different phone number all of my phone information has been transferred onto his phone as well, so when I get a text or message he also receives it this has been impossible to change I have spent way to much time trying without success to rectify this issue.",1
895,Amazing quality. Looked new. Was not reported stolen. Got Iphone 8 as expected.I ordered this as ATT is doing a promo turn in Iphone 8 get Iphone 12 for free which I did.Thanks.,5
896,My daughter bought this phone with all of her savings and only 4 months later it has crashed. The message is stating press home to upgrade but it will not go beyond that screen. Verizon told us to check with apple store (which is 2 hours away) but it may or may not be fixable. Very disappointing.,2
897,"I really do not have much to Review.  I received the Phone and Case, Shield, two day's ahead of schedule, Great!  Took it to my Carrier, she was able to... whatever they do, to make it mine, very quickly.  But, this has Nothing to do with Amazon, but the iPhone 8, doesn't have a Headphone Jack.  I had to go out and buy a Bluetooth headset, No biggy, but.  Overall, I am pleased!",5
898,Much better then I expected. The phone is like brand new  great battery life and no scratches on phone,5
899,"Phone came in on time and was working alright, had minor glitches and errors. I thought it was because it was updating and syncing to the account. Find out you can’t use any programs and then immediately shuts down and does nothing. Even with force reboot the phone only began working again for another 2-3 days. Was very dissatisfied.",1
900,"The product seems fine and I would be 100% satisfied if the phone had come in perfect condition. There are a few small scarrches on screen and one on side of phone. But overall, its functioning so yeah.",3
901,very nice phone for cheat price. my unit recieve in excellent condition. always trust them. very nice phone,5
902,"iPhone was stolen, it can't read any SIM card. Don't bother, $200 down the drain.",1
903,Very happy with this purchase. I bought a straight talk SIM card. Inserted it in my iphone and worked perfectly no issues at all. I would recommend this to anyone.,5
904,"I had an excellent experience with this product! 87% battery, like new condition. Keep it up, would love to purchase again from you all. When I’m looking for quality I’ll check you guys",5
905,I got the iphone 8 and im returning it now to the seller in exchange for a new phone. The phone im sending back restarted at least 50+ times and turned off completely 20+ times and took forever to turn on. Audio was bad to and couldn't hear people talk,1
906,"Tammy was our go to person and resolved issue with expertise and expediency.Thanks much, we highly recommend this seller.",5
907,I bought this phone as an upgrade from my last phone which I also bought from the same seller. My last phone lasted me 4 years no issues and I’m confident this upgrade will last just as long. Very good quality.,5
908,I just recieved this iphone 8 for my son for his birthday May 17 2021. That I paid 200.00 for and the battery wont charge. Soon as it is unplugged it shuts OFF. I would appreciate at least a replacement battery,1
909,"I bought this iphone for my nephew, I was hesitant at first because it was refurbished. When it came he was so excited to open it.  He loved it.  It looked like a brand new phone. There was no scratches on the screen or the phone. He was able to use the phone with no problem.  The picture are so clear. This is definitely worth the price!",5
910,Phone came back in good shape good shipping battery life was OK fingerprint reader worked all in all good phone for the price I am happy with it it’s been my phone for the last year almost,5
911,"I loved my iPhone!  Arrived on time, no scratches, unlocked, working perfectly. I just needed to go to Metropcs to authorize the SIM card.",5
912,Great product. Looks new. Functions well. No complaints. I did have an issue with the phone but customer service replied quickly and exchanged for another one promptly. I would recommend this company. Great product. Great customer service.,5
913,This company sent me a phone that did not work. The home screen button & the side turn off/on button did not work. I sent it back immediately. My refund was rejected because the phone did not work. It obviously didn’t work that is why I sent it back. They kept the phone and didn’t refund my money. It’s a scam. Don’t purchase from kiss electronics.,1
914,"Just received it and transferred my data from my iCloud. Phone appears in perfect condition, I even checked around the corners where it could’ve been dropped but it’s flawless. Went into the battery status in settings and it’s at 100% efficiency. For half the price of a new iPhone, I can’t justify spending more on my phone than my television. So far so good, but if anything happens to pop up, I’ll update my review.",5
915,The screen is not very responsive towards the bottom near the home button and it also cracked off near the home button and near the camera lense despite having put a protective screen cover and not having dropped it.,2
916,Great phone!  I generally don’t write reviews. I needed a new phone but couldn’t  afford a new phone price.  I looked. online for  weeks for a refurbished phone at a good price with good reviews.I love this phone.  It functions great and  it looks brand new.  I am very satisfied.,5
917,"The Iphone was in very good condition battery life 88% only drawback and a couple of digs around the bezel, one on the top and one on the bottom is kind of like a dig. There is a glass screen protector on the phone. So far so good",5
918,"Has bare minimum 80% battery. Other than that super pleased. Screen perfect. Very minor scuffs on the back, one tiny chip on the frame. Nice packaging. I use it as a music player so the battery is fine and I can always get it replaced. I paid $209 which was a great price. Highly recommend!",4
919,Couldn’t tell it was refurbished.,5
920,"Don’t buy this... was told it had apple care. The serial number on the SIM tray showed it did, but the actual number assigned to the phone itself did not have apple care. Phone started smoking after a couple months of use and had to pay full price for a new phone from apple. Very sketchy and not worth it. Just buy a new phone through apple and cut out the unnecessary “renewed” middle man",1
921,"Amazing!!! I’ve had my phone for a little under a month now and I love it. For such a small price it is definitely worth it. For those of you scared of buying used things, if you’re not satisfied you can return it. My phone came 2 days early and it activated perfectlyAt first my texts kept sending to my old phone but I believe that’s my carriers fault.Regardless, I do not regret this at all!!!!",4
922,Battery didn’t work! Was supposed to be a Christmas gift and so upset. Had to return gift and order a new one!,1
923,Arrived before the date! Well packaged with no imperfections!! All works well and I am very happy with this purchase. Saved a lot of money!!,5
924,My son opened this on Christmas and we took it to get it all set up and we found out it is still attached to someone else so now I have to return it and he has no phone. I’m sorry but people should not be able to sell these phones! If it’s truly being checked out then how can they not know it’s still on someone’s account. Also the person who had this phone still owed money on it. What a let down on Christmas!!!!!!,1
925,Came in and looks brand new.  Absolutely no problem setting it up.  Everything works great on it. I would buy again and recommend 150 %.,5
926,"This was exactly as I had hoped. The phone arrived in perfect condition. The battery is not new, but it does make it thru the day without dying. Works as promised with no issues.",5
927,Overall the phone was a good purchase. Can’t give a fair review as I only bought it to trade in for an iPhone 12.,5
928,"They didn’t even check the phone camera before selling it, I was lucky to try to take a picture and then realized the rear camera lens was jumping inside that you could hear a weird noise and the image jumping as well making impossible to take a picture or video. Thanks to Amazon I sent it back to them.",1
929,"Excellent phone! (The only scratches are the ones I put on the back... oops) came with no scratches and 93% battery health, I recommend buying this before spending hundreds on a brand new one",5
930,"I have a month using the phone. I was happy because at first it worked very well. But after a month the screen has turned black and does not react ... I have decided to return it but I have not been able to erase the personal information that is inside the phone. I need help, I feel ripped off.",1
931,"I’m happy. Had a smal dent on a corner, nothing like what I expected though. Great phone, seems new, and clean",5
932,"Great upgrade from 7! No problem migrating from old phone,? Looks great and works better than the 7!",5
933,"Good phone to use as a trade in for promos. Owned phone for a day before trading in at T Mobile. Sales Rep. accepted phone, without any problems! Highly recommend especially because of the fast shipping!",5
934,I’m always nervous about buying phones. The reviews on this one looked good sooooo I went for it and was not disappointed.The phone is great. Looks like a new phone.I’ve had it for a couple months and it’s been great.,5
935,screen with small broken and the battery life not work. I'm not happy because the ad didn't say anything about the battery life and the little broken one on the screen,1
936,Item came as described. No defects or issues. Happy with my purchase and would recommend!,5
937,"Defective: voice microphone did not work, spent 3 hours on the phone with my cell phone provider - no success - the phone couldn’t have been checked out and verified. Very disappointed and over five hours of my tine wasted.",1
938,Feels and looks like a brand new one.,5
939,I am using it now. It delivered fast with nice packing! I used my T mobile SIM card of my I phone 7 for it and it worked perfectly fine.I really did not expect the phone with this great condition as new one. I am so happy about it with 100 battery life too.,5
940,"Phone came exactly as described. No imperfections and works great so far. For the $250 price tag, I highly recommend to anyone in need a replacement but not wanting to pay Apples retail price tags.",5
941,I bought this as a birthday gift and could not be happier! Looks and works great! Had only a few minor scratches on it and those were covered with a case and screen protector.,5
942,"So far, all is good. Set up wand transfer went smoothly and phone is operating well.  It was in great shape.",5
943,This is a great phone and the price was great. I am very pleased as well as my child.,5
944,"The screen is detached and out of square from the body of the phone, I returned it, poor quality products,",1
945,"Phone was in good exterior condition. However, phone battery was going dead after five minutes or so even when fully charged. This was although battery health was 93%.  Even while it was charging it would go dead sometimes. Don’t live in the US so was unable to return as I was on holiday when the phone was received. Had to buy a battery and pay a technician to change it. Do not buy.",1
946,I bought this device in late July and received it in August.Device worked well for 6 months and the speaker stopped working and then the mic.First it was the loud speakers. I did a factory reset thinking this would solve the issue.  However it got worse.  There ear piece speaker went.And then lastly the mic went.  So there phone is basically a big paper weight now.Save you're money buy a new phone or from another supplier,1
947,It was someone else phone from a couple of yrs ago. They never paid it off. Not worth it. Sprint couldn't do anything about it,1
948,I bought this phone and we weren’t able to unlock it. I took it to the Apple store and they told us it was stolen and they couldn’t unlock it.,1
949,My teen son likes the phone and has no problems with it. It's a good value for the money.,3
950,Replace old model,5
951,"After 2 weeks of having this phone, there’s one problem. The bottom/main speaker stopped working and now I can only hear audio from the top speaker, the speaker used for hearing calls, now I can barely hear audio even at max volume, I don’t know how to fix this. I guess I got unfortunate and got a bad phone, this shouldn’t happen to anybody, by at your own risk.",2
952,MY PHONE DIDNT EVEN WORK WHEN I FIRST GOT IT I HAD TO BUY A WHOLE NEW BATTERY BECAUSE IT WONT CHARGE OR TURN ON. GOOD PHONE BUT BAD FIRST IMPRESSION (DO NOT BUY) AND IF YOU DO BE READY TO PERFORM A BATTERY REPLACEMENT,1
953,Just thanks! iPhone 8 came with 95% battery and in close to new condition. i would say to any observer is really new. There is no reasons to complain. I'm very satisfied! Thanks a lot.,5
954,"Phone came with only 86% battery health, drains very quickly. Also, the phone is from Japan. There is NO way to switch off the camera shutter sound when taking a photo on snapchat. This is because of the laws in Japan. Would love if Amazon was more forthcoming about the origins of these phones, would NOT recommend buying this phone.",1
955,No andaba la pantalla touch. Tuve que devolverlo. Un trastorno!,1
956,"This device functions pretty well, but impossible to hold a conversation using voice.  Out of the box, the mic does not work well at all.",2
957,"I have bought this phone, I phone 8, and used for 2 months and the Camera was not working. I have return the item and have to wait more than a month and still have not received the return money yet. I do not influence any friend of my to buy anything from this Provider any more. So distressful and not convenience. Sorry to have to say so if it hurt your feeling.",1
958,The Apple iPhone 8 came in pristine condition. Not a scratch on the device. The battery life is great. Phone has been used for 2 weeks now and not one single problem. Seller sent the phone quickly. Very happy customer.,5
959,Only draw back the headphones on this phone are the charging port... this didn’t come with the adapter to fit beats ... had to buy separate.  Also I don’t like that it comes with a generic cord... they charge slowly... but great for my middle school child.,5
960,I purchased as an upgrade for my mom.  It's January 2021 and she's still using it.  It works perfectly!,5
961,Received product in amazing pretty much new. Looks brand new except the box it came in. Great phone for my 10 year old’s birthday gift and first phone.,5
962,This item did not hold a charge rendering it useless. It was returned.,1
963,"Perfect gift for my daughter. Not ready for an expensive version, and still gets plenty of options.",5
964,"so I returned it w/in the 90 days and the screen cracked a tiny bit in shipping it back for repairs so they just sent it back without fixing the mic.  So I said fine, I'll use the warranty to get the mic and screen fixed and they said there is no warranty.  WTF!",1
965,This product was misrepresented it did not do what it said in the description it was not T-Mobile friendly or completely unlocked,1
966,"Phone looks new and was extremely easy to activate on Xfinity, just swapped the SIM card, that’s all and was good to go. Only indication it was a used phone was the battery life indicator was at 86%. Fair enough, still keeps a charge better than my last phone.",5
967,"Bought an iPhone that said it was set up for T-Mobile. Went to two stores and was on the phone for 1.5 hours. End result, this phone would not work with T-Mobile.False advertisement or wrong phone sent to me. Unsure.",1
968,Not only did it not work but the seller would not replace it immediately (imagine being out a phone for a week plus!)... not happy about this.,1
969,Problems trying to activate it at the T-mobile store and ended up trading it in for an iPhone 12.,1
970,This phone has more storage. Takes awhile to get used to the different functions.,5
971,I ordered this phone because it was a newer version and priced good. When I received the phone everything seemed fine but then I discovered that the camera does not work on it. I have a young daughter and pictures are a big part of my life so very bummed out camera doesn’t work.,3
972,"When I received the phone, the packaging looked like someone ran over it with a tank. I’ve had this phone for about 3 months and this phone has randomly shut off and kicks me off my WiFi more times than I can count. The phone also keeps telling me to get a data upgrade which I’ve never had happen to me before when I’ve bought an iPhone on Amazon. I was trying to save money by buying a phone here, but I was just severely disappointed with this brand new phone acting like I’ve had it for 3 years.",2
973,"This product was delivered promptly and as advertised. It works great, just as it should.",5
974,"This product is good but what was cheaped out was that the phone literally dies after it is unplugged. And the finger print doesn’t work either. But other than that, everything is the same as the IPhone 7.",3
975,"Overall, the phone came out great. I guess the only complaint I have is it’s charging. It charges fine but it doesn’t stay charged as long as it should. But other than that, very happy with my purchase! Fantastic for a refurbished iPhone!",3
976,Works very good for me know. Install Mint Mobil on it. $15.00 A MONTH service.,5
977,"When we ordered this phone we were concerned as some of the reviews were not great. Our daughter wanted this specific phone for her birthday, so we held our breath and ordered. It's been a great phone for her!  I have recommended several friends to order as well.",5
978,Good working so far so good no headphones and stuff like new one but oh well got Charger and phone,5
979,This product did not meet my expectations for that reason I return it back to the sender,1
980,"I was a little hesitant ordering a used phone online, but I couldn't be happier with this buy. It came with no flaws/scratches and honestly looked unused. It charged to 100% within an hour too. My daughter is extremely happy with her phone and hasn't put it down since getting it.",5
981,This was a wonderful phone it was easy to set up and has been working very good,5
982,"I needed a new phone didn’t think I would trust buying a iPhone from Amazon, so I gave it a try for the first time and let me tell you I was so happy with my purchase!!! So worth it works great had no problems.",5
983,"Ordered this phone to replace my son’s broken phone. Received the white and silver phone rather than the space grey I ordered, which was a little disappointing but was ok. Phone worked great. Touchscreen was responsive. Battery life lasted all day. No major cosmetic damages. Overall a good buy.",5
984,"This phone was like new, it was perfect. no scratches or even fingerprints. I would buy from this vendor anytime. It came to me just like they advertised. Great product.  It was a great experience working with them",5
985,Honestly everything worked on the phone... it was in perfect condition for being renewed but the camera was the only thing messed up... other than that completely worth it,4
986,Este equipo no ha llegado ustedes no deben trabajar con usps y ustedes debes de saber el paradero,1
987,I took this phone to sprint and the phone was unable to locate any service! the customer service agent informed me that the phone had internal issues that could only be resolved the manufacture itself.  Not even the Apple/Mac store was unable to help.,1
988,"I’ve only had it for one (1) day so far, but so far so good!  Looks like brand new, I love it!",5
989,Phone looks great and works just fine.I waited to do the review for a few days to make sure it worked like it should.Fast shipping would recommend them to friends and family if your looking to buy a phone.,5
990,Love refurbished phones. Got one with good battery life and no screen scratches. Very happy.,5
991,Great product had some issues in the beginning but the straightened it out right away I love my new phone,5
992,Everything seems OK little scratch. Not bad. But for some reason I can't get texts from a couple numbers. I can send and call but nothing else. 3rd thing I order this week with problems. I had to review take the time wait for the stuff and now they're just asking you to send it back what's going to make me want to order anything else.?,2
993,What can I say except the phone is great. They are great. Much appreciated.,5
994,I'm very satisfied with the product. There is no scratches or any cosmetic issues. It's like a new phone with screen protection film. And headphone works great with charging adapter.,5
995,"I have not had any issues with my new phone so far (I have been using it for about 4 days). Getting the phone set up and all of my data moved onto it was no problem. It says that the battery has 97% capacity, which is within the range that the description suggested. I would order this product refurbished again (but hopefully I don't have to :) )",5
996,Absolutely love this phone. It’s in perfect condition with a screen protector already on it and it came in 2 days early,5
997,The camera shutter click will not turn off! I’ve tried everything.... from what I found this phone must be from Japan or Korea b/c it’s law that the camera sound is always on. So that’s annoying....,3
998,I was surprised I thought it would for sure be broken or not working at all,5
999,"Only been using reserviced model for less than a week. So far so good. Arrived before scheduled date. Also as described, no extras.",4
1000,Great price!!! I received a phone without scratches and excellent conditions. I’m very satisfied with my purchase.,5
1001,Phone came locked with a carrier. Had to go through a ton of bs and wait 72 hrs to get it unlocked.,3
1002,Ordered 15 to give away for x mas 7 out of 15 had batteries that would not hold a charge. Will not buy from here again,5
1003,"En excelente estado, realmente lo recomiendo.",5
1004,Phone was not unlocked as listed. Completely unsatisfied.  Had to pay to get it unlocked.,1
1005,"El equipo parece salido  de fábrica, lastimosamente no vino con el adaptador  para audífonos",5
1006,"I got exactly what was described! Phone came clean & functional. No visible blemishes or issues. I chose a seller with a great rating, though- make sure you check when ordering renewed products!",5
1007,"Still gets all the updates to iOS, large screen, great battery life, good cameras and all the tech you'd want for (at the moment) way under $400usd. So happy I did this instead of get an X or anything new which right now is more than double. My particular refurbished unit came with an aftermarket (but still very fast) charger and cable.",5
1008,"The seller was one of the most helpful and professional sellers I've ever done business with. I had an initial problem with the serial number but as soon as I registered a complaint, the seller reached out to me within 15min and kept in touch until the issue was resolved. I received another phone and everything worked out great! I'd definitely use the seller ""Hybrid IT"" again!",5
1009,"Very pleased with the quality and condition of the phone - a few scratches around the top of the phone, by my case covers them. My phone even arrived a day earlier than expected - even with a hurricane looming! My new phone was easy to set up and it have all of the info from my old phone transferred. Would definitely recommend this seller! The even included a screen protector!",5
1010,It’s in a great condition. Has signs off wear and tear but that’s expected. Battery health came on 86% not the best but it’ll do. Fingerprint scanner work perfectly same as the camera 8/10,4
1011,Is good but the color of the lcd is kind of pink is not like the original,4
1012,"Teléfono en muy mal estado! La bocina no sirve, la pantalla falla, la batería esta en muy mal estado, tiene muchos golpes y rayones, Básicamente me enviaron basura!",1
1013,this is a replacement unit. it works but I had some kinks I had to work on via apple,4
1014,"Arrived almost two weeks later than expected!As soon as the battery was  starting to run low, i charged it. After that, the screen got black (battery wasn’t drained) and it never turned back on. Had to return it. No problem at all when requesting a refund",1
1015,After using one month the battery is not charging and the earphones don't work.,1
1016,"arrived ahead of the storm, easy transfer, looks new! arrived over 60% charged.will definitely keep MobileSpree's name for future purchases!",5
1017,"Phone is exactly as described, perfect condition however it was manufacture in Japan where they design the phones so the shutter sound on the camera can NEVER be silenced. Returning this phone for that reason.",2
1018,"Iphone 8 for just $170, all I needed. The item looks like new. It works perfect.",5
1019,Loved how I could order online and get it delivered to my front door instead of driving across town and standing in line! Love the phone. Have had no problems with it. Highly recommend it.,5
1020,Hardly any volume in the headset. The only way you can talk to anyone or hear anything is if you use headphones. The battery will not charge past 70%. I'm sure every refurbish is different but I found this one very disappointing.,2
1021,We returned the phone because the sound did not work.  We received a full refund.,1
1022,"The product came a day before :o) easy data transfer from other iPhone.  Descriptions were pretty accurate: condition of the phone looks brand new, battery health 87% though not know how long the charge lasted since l needed a 5.5 screen—error on my part.  Returning the product.",5
1023,"I was surprised, especially after all this reviews, but I think it was my lucky day, so everything works fine (1 week use), I tested it in special app. Hope it will remain the same.",5
1024,I’ll Let you know when I find out what happened to it! Fedex said it was delivered. Surprise...not,1
1025,"La verdad me defraudó!!! Se apaga a cada rato ,no funciona bien ,MUY DEFRAUDADO !!!!!!",1
1026,I don’t know battery life yet because I just received it but I am very impressed. It looks brand new and is great!,5
1027,"The battery on my phone is terrible , but maybe that’s just how Apple is.. my phone will die so fast it’s amazing and I’m constantly charging it. I should have returned this but whatever cuz I think this is just an Apple problem",4
1028,Absolutely amazing! Just what I was looking for. Works perfectly. No hesitation to purchase from this seller again. If you have any worries about purchasing don’t! My phone is everything and more! Thanks so much! XoX,5
1029,"Battery sucks does not last long at all constantly recharging it, besides that its great",3
1030,Not good froze up immediately was a real hassle didnt connect to network,1
1031,"Description says ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice..."" but doesn't work with Sprint so I had to return the phone.",1
1032,"Received the phone in excellent condition and working order. Popped out my Sim and put in the new phone, transferred my info, and everything works fine. Came with a screen protector and charger. Would recommend!",5
1033,"The phone works great for everything except the ear piece.  It works just fine, it’s just hard to hear.  Everything else, it’s like a brand new phone.",5
1034,"Purchased as ""used"".  Love it!  Have not had any issues.  Battery life is excellent.  Great condition.  Well worth the $avings!!",5
1035,No le anda el altavoz de abajo .Una pena. No lo puedo mandar dado que estoy en Uruguay.,2
1036,I really wish we could use it. But it's just basically a game unit or good for the web and talking to others who have an I phone m,4
1037,"I bought it in the United stated but moved out to an international country so i could not return. When i first got it, it was super glitchy. I reset the software and it stopped glitching but it would keep randomly shutting off and getting stuck on the apple logo. Now after a. month it doesn't even want to turn on. This is a waste of money. Don't buy anything from them. You will lose.",1
1038,Buying a renewed phone was a great way for me to upgrade affordable,5
1039,Omg such an upgrade from my 6! Use my phone for work and this just made it so much better. It’s in perfect condition and so much faster.,5
1040,"Tried to activate phone on Verizon account and it would not work despite numerous attempts.  Certified Verizon store with people who knew what they were doing.  They said it was defective.  Also, when I ordered it said Amazon Prime but it took 3 full days to arrive instead of the promised 2.  So, buyer beware.  I won’t order again - too much wasted time.",1
1041,This screen protector is so solid and feels really high end. I’m happy to have something that will protect my phone really well for an affordable price,5
1042,"Received my phone today (advertised as ""Unlocked"") but unable to activate since a previous owner failed to meet a financial obligation (see attached pic). Thus, the phone is worthless and cannot be used. I'm returning and hoping the replacement will actually work as advertised.",1
1043,"Great deal, Amazon warranty brand new looking and working phone. Very pleased.",5
1044,"Phone looks and has been working (for a few weeks) perfectly. Physical condition was 10/10, set up was easy. Charged it for about 2 hours and inserted my sim card, everything transferred right away. No technical or battery issues, would buy again",5
1045,Reading other reviews made me very nervous to see how this phone was going to turn out. But luckily it works perfectly ! There are no problems I have been facing and i’ve had the phone for about two months now. And it is indeed fully unlocked. I tried it with a Cricket and Metro-pcs sim card and they both worked with the phone. I would recommend buying this phone. :),5
1046,I was sold a phone reported as stolen.  It will not work with any network.  Complete rip-off,1
1047,"Excellent condition, like new!Not a single scratch, and it’s a brand new battery installed (100% max cap health).New charger and cable.Extremely surprised/pleased by the quality of product and packaging from seller.",5
1048,"Very happy with the phone, like new condition though the battery, not surprising and warned in advance, is not 100%. I am quite happy with the purchase.",5
1049,"Bought the item for my 13 years dauther who lives abroad. activated it only when I returned to my homeland overseas. two weeks in use, and the device stopped working. so frustrating - couldn't get any refund nor return the item (because too much time has passed and I no longer live in America...). so frustrating - just lost my money. I advise against buying.",1
1050,All I wanted was a decent working phone so I bought this and I went to go activate it today or attempted to and it was reported missing or stolen I will be returning this ASAP I’m very disappointed,1
1051,"The phone arrived with a scratch in a corner. When contacted the response was ""our devices are sold as renewed which is supposed to have minor scratches."" So be aware that your device may arrive in a similar condition.",1
1052,"Battery dont last, and also problem with sound. My wife has to use speakers or headphones to talk all the time, otherwise she wound hear nothing...",3
1053,So far so good. It worked perfectly.  I have an account with att go phone prepaid. I had no issue transferring from my old iPhone to this one. Work great. Keep it my fingers crossed. Seems like a steal. Too good to be true. Affordable iPhone works with prepaid no issue transferring photos contacts and apps.,5
1054,"I received this product a couple of hours ago and it is as it should be. Clean glass and phone. Everything included. The problem I’m having is the battery is severely degraded. The phone powers off randomly and restarts. I will be returning this product. Very disappointing, I had high hopes.",1
1055,"Everything is good not until I checked the status of the battery, 75% max. That’s a let down. Would have been ok atleast 85% not 75%.",3
1056,"I got this phone and everything was perfect, no cracks and everything worked. Except for the SIM card slotMetro couldn’t help me either, after a week going to return it and took my sim out and placed it back in. Some how it’s all fineOne star less for the scare",4
1057,"Bought the phone with high hopes. Once I received the phone, I did everything as instructed. The service wasn't working for some reason. I took it to the Verizon store and was notified that the phone was locked for Verizon service when I specifically bought it for the unlocked status. Returned it and hoping that the next one isn't another failure...to be continued.",1
1058,I’m returning back to iPhones once again and this is the perfect One to start with. Yes the battery after I charge it in the morning it stays charged all dayMy calls are clear my music is too I love the pics too. Great ph,5
1059,If I could give a zero I would. Phone arrived with the screen installed incorrectly.  It sits too high causing the home button too be depressed but since the screen sits above the phone casing it cracks easily around the edges.  Still waiting for the company to reply with an answer to return it.  I’m not holding my breath and will have to repair it myself.,1
1060,The phone overall is just fine. I thought that the battery would be leaps and bounds better than my 6S. It is a marked improvement but certainly doesn’t last all day with typical usage. The phones were received with no packaging around it. The phone was in the iPhone box but the box had opened in transit and when the box was opened the phone was faced down in the box. I am concerned on the long-term jostling that the phone received in transit.,4
1061,The iphone 8 is incredible.  All the reviews do not do it justice.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.,5
1062,"This product works good, it came with scratches on the screen but when i was putting on my screen protector it came with a wet wipe and the scratches came right off, the battery life came with 90% I would rather prefer 100% but it’s renewed so I can’t change that. Over all this prude to works and fella like new no cracks or anything on the back or front 👍🏻",4
1063,"The product worked for about a month. However, it came in with fine scratches on the screen, which wasn’t a huge deal- small disappointment. Then shortly after the charger started working improperly. You would have to sit it in the perfect spot to charge. Now it will not charge at all! This was a very big waste of money & disappointment.",1
1064,Many people are saying the battery life is bad but I have had it for a month and ZERO problems. Great time connecting to WiFi. Completely unlocked and isn’t lagging. I was very stressed but it’s great.,5
1065,"Phone came shipped with a glass screen protector which is a nice touch. Product was everything I expected,  IOS says battery health is at 88% which is normal considering it’s age, overall very pleased with my purchase. Will definitely be buying from this merchant again when I need a new phone.",5
1066,The first phone they sent me had 89% battery health and said it needed to be serviced (repaired) so I contacted the seller and they worked with me and exchanged it for another iPhone 8 with 100% battery health and no apparent problems.,5
1067,"Excellent condition, works great and the battery holds up very well.",5
1068,Do not buy and do not hook up Apple account on WiFi to it before u find out ur carrier can not can not use the phone and have to return it. I may be paranoid but even if u factory reset phone it never really gets deleted. Food for thought. Just might be a scam to get info on u. Also my first review on Amazon. Never felt the need to rate a product til now,1
1069,"Received in excellent shape, looks new and works fine. No Problems!",5
1070,Unable to hear through ear piece!Also new software shows orange dot near battery when I make phone calls. I researched it and this mean someone is listening to my phone calls!,1
1071,The was a great looking phone but my T-mobile provider could not set it up on my account. It was T-mobile compatible but could not get the international lock off. No way to contact seller directly left message but no response had to return the phone. Bought the same phone from different sell no problem.,2
1072,Only had this phone for 3 months. Its already acting up. Constantly freezing up and dropping calls. My screen goes blank and I had to force restart this phone multiple times. Dont waist your money,1
1073,"Had about 3 or 4 deep noticeable scratches along the edges of the screen. Came with a screen protector to try to cover up the blemishes. Other than that, everything works great. It isn’t perfect. The fingerprint reader might freeze a few times, but nothing that makes me not like the phone. Came with a non branded charger which charges faster than the original apple charger. No headphones. Its decent. For the price, you can’t beat it.",4
1074,"A major upgrade from my iPhone 4 which died after many years of use. I use a phone to talk to people, text,  and play Solitaire so I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new model so this was perfect.",5
1075,After receiving I noticed that the envelope and box was a little damaged. After opening I noticed that the front glass and camera were fine but the back glass was completely shattered and the phone was already logged into another Apple ID. Everything else seemed to work fine but I promptly returned the product and am awaiting a refund.,1
1076,So far the phone has performed very well as expected from an Apple product. Perhaps it’s too early to evaluate the battery issue.We are happy with this product.,5
1077,The phone won’t even turn on and unfortunately it was a gift for someone who’s not in the country smh.  Worst decision buying this,1
1078,"The phone came with a glass screen protector on it, didn’t come with headphones but came with charger. The battery lasts a long time, the phone is fast, and it looks new. Haven’t had any problems so far!!",5
1079,"The phone only has 85% battery health, which means it has been used for at least over 2 years.The camera is scratched with an obvious line across the camera lense.The phone is at best a “used phone”, not a “renewed” product.Very disappointed, and I have to go to the post office and send it back..Frustrated experience.",2
1080,"I got it a day early, and it looks new to me.",5
1081,I was quite happy with my purchase the phone is in Pristine condition when I received it. Battery Health is 96%. Activation was extremely easy on Verizon network been using the phone for over a week no issues,5
1082,So far great phone! Little issue with volume control but resolved now! Seller is great and will buy from seller again!,5
1083,We have not had any issues. We are already AT&T customers so updating/upgrading was not an issue.,5
1084,Everything else was seemingly fine except the battery. The battery drains very quickly. Confirmed that battery was degraded worse than the 80% advertised. Had to replace battery to continue using the phone.Apple said the phone is not eligible for Apple Care.,2
1085,"Excellent quality, no scratches, works perfect, my daughter love it.",5
1086,The phone physically was in great shape. The battery however doesn’t seem like it’s holding a charge long enough,3
1087,Just arrived.  VERY FAST SHIPPING! (Thank you). Seems to be in great condition for being renewed.  Everything works well so far.,5
1088,The battery only stay 15 minutes after fully chargeI never saw worries IPhone like that.They don’t received even my money when I ship to them .,1
1089,I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She absolutely loves it.,5
1090,"The phone itself works fine with no issues except that the keyboard freaks out randomly when trying to type anything. Makes for a very frustrating time texting and searching internet, having to backspace several times t get out what you are trying to type.",3
1091,This phone was a Christmas gift.  It works flawlessly so far and it looks brand new.,5
1092,Product was in perfect condition.  Works great. The chip was inserted and it fired right up. No complaints.,5
1093,"Works great, looks almost like new (just a tiny scratch on the screen), battery health  at100 %, still in warranty.",5
1094,"Horrible phone. My camera shakes like Michael J Fox is holding it.Horrible customer service. If I receive a damaged $300 device, I want to talk to someone; not an automated service that says it will take a few days for them to get back to me.Do not order from these people.",1
1095,"The battery didn’t work properly, tried to get help from the seller, not cool, as his name was just looping without a solution....thanks Amazon that Helped me with this...",1
1096,I phone 8 was in great condition and worked well .. A great value,5
1097,It took me a while to actually write a review on this because I wanted to be sure about the battery life and use it for a while. I’m usually  skeptical about refurbished products because something is usually wrong with it. But this phone works like brand new. I’m glad I didn’t regret this .,5
1098,"The phones are working well for us, thank you very much!!!",5
1099,"I’ve personally purchased 4 different phones from Amazon over the last 4 years and have never had any problems with any of them. They always arrive in great condition and have worked like new to this day. And, this purchase follows suit. Perfect condition and works great!",5
1100,The iPhone I received is in excellent condition and works great so far,5
1101,"They sent me a phone with a terrible battery,it gets hot and only lasts for  maybe a half hour from fully charged,the print reader doesn’t work and the call reception sucks.I’ll change my rating when they rectify the situation!",1
1102,"Bought it. Delivered on time but doesn’t start. No charging light when plugged in. Clearly doesn’t work. Will be returning.Based on all the negative feed back and now mine, Amazon needs to drop BuySpy from their renewed options.",1
1103,"Received phone, phone does not work! Called customer service and was given the run around, buyer beware!",1
1104,Arrived in like new condition. And has worked flawlessly.,5
1105,"Perfect .phone came unlocked and in mint state. Packaging is a general phone box,no the original one. Charger and cable are aftermarket",5
1106,Phone works great and battery goes all day without recharging.,5
1107,"Only thing that I didn’t like was that I had to clean the speakers so the sound sounded right. Other than that, the phone came in near perfect condition.",4
1108,"Compre 3 equipos y de los 3 equipos ninguno vino en buenas condiciones, uno de ellos me vino con pantalla sin True Tone lo que significa que no es una pantalla original, mucho desgaste y muy desprolijos le pongo dos estrellas por que funcionan el Touch ID  Pero no volvería comprar a este vendedor.",2
1109,"Great phone! Loved it. Easy to use. But like any used phone, it has a bad battery life.",5
1110,It doesn't take charge. I tried with different chargers including the one that it came with it and nothing happen.Do not buy this kind of phone. Pay a litle bit more and buy it new,1
1111,"Great product from a good company. Excellent communication with them. Device came way before estimated delivery date. The unit is in very good condition, with only minor scuffs. I even received a screen protector which I didn't even expect. Would definitely buy from the again!",5
1112,Daughter is happy with it it works and honestly that’s all that matters,5
1113,Thanks a lot my iPhone 8 is working great really love it,5
1114,This was to replace my Mom's broken iPhone 6. Nice phone.,5
1115,"Good phone, bad battery",1
1116,The battery doesn’t stay charged all day which now I have to get a new battery. Not sure if the seller can help me out with a new battery?,4
1117,"This was a really good buy! It works out of the United States (which was my main concern because I’m a missionary in South America), and it was in perfect condition. Mine even came with a screen protector already attached! I’m bad about dropping my phone so that was definitely a plus. The battery life is sooo much better than my previous 6S, and the camera and everything works wonderfully. The only, ONLY reason I didn’t put a glowing five stars is because I didn’t get any headphones with it, but to be honest, I have no idea if stock iPhone 8’s come with headphones or not either, since they have to be Bluetooth or lightning.",4
1118,There was nothing i did not like from this iPhone. It was gorgeous. Not a scratch on it and looked and sounded brand new. I love it. And it is going from my home all the way to Africa. To a young man who needed a phone. He just received it and he is thrilled his old phone was dying and could not keep a charge. I was just thrilled when i opened the box. Wow again thank you.,5
1119,It shipped fast and arrived two days before it was supposed to. I upgraded my grandma from a 6s to an 8 & obviously there’s no changes so she didn’t have to adjust to anything. Phone works & looks like new. Great buy & she could use it with Xfinity Mobile .,5
1120,The phone is perfectly in working condition with no cosmetic wear or tear. I was really impressed when I received the phone as it does looks like a New iPhone. I have received the phone on time and the setup worked fine without any issues. I would recommend anyone who is interested to purchase!,5
1121,"I had to replace the included charging cable after only a few uses, as it stopped charging the phone. The phone itself was in good condition and had a better than advertised battery life. I swapped out the charging cable and so far all appears to be working. Will live with the phone a little longer and provide an update around the 30-day mark.",4
1122,Minor mark on the back of the phone but as far as the phones performance so far so good,5
1123,"Can I trade this I Phone 8 for a I Phone 8 Plus can not get it to ring on incoming calls, go to settings and it rings nice and loud but does not ring at calls and it is to small a screen for 86 year old and also can I trade it in for an 8 plus! Help",3
1124,"Great price for the phone, however the battery was bad. It's a great phone for my kid after I replaced the battery.",4
1125,Bought phone for my daughter for Christmas which was early December 2020. Right at 3 months the battery goes bad in the phone. Contacted the seller trying to just exchange my product and received. Generic response telling me to reset my phone or contact an Apple dealer. 0 stars don’t buy this product. Got 3 months of use for 250 dollars!!!!!!,1
1126,"Works perfectly for my 11 year old. Looked new, but came with aftermarket charger (which was new in the box).",4
1127,I bought this phone in January had a 3-month warranty on it and after the warranty ran out I got to charge my battery two or three times a day I will not buy another iPhone,2
1128,"Looked brand-new ! No visible scuffs, scratches or scrapes. Battery life seems near-perfect. Works perfectly! I am very pleased.",5
1129,"I have had this phone for one week and it is no longer charging.Update: The company was easy to work with and refunded the cost of a new battery and charger, which seems to have fixed the issue. Good customer service.",4
1130,"Works like new batter life good, volume slightly lower then expected but not a big deal.  Worth it.",4
1131,I use it all the time for everything that a phone is made for.,5
1132,I bought the iPhone 8 with a hesitation about the quality... You can check the quality relative to new of the battery in the Settings - Battery - Battery Health settings of the phone. The battery dropped 4% in efficiency in the 2 weeks I had it. It was annoying returning it. Just saying.,2
1133,"Good price, and I certainly can't tell it isn't new.",5
1134,Good product as advertised no scratches as new works perfect,5
1135,Llame a AT&T y el teléfono sigue bloqueado por el antiguo dueñoEl dueño tiene que llamar u desbloquear el telefono,1
1136,Phone came working better than expected. Battery life maximum efficiency was at 80%. Not bad for a renewed phone with a 90-day warranty. No scratches or signs of use or wear and tear,5
1137,"Thoroughly pleased with the way this product was shipped, delivered faster then expected, and exceptionally met expectations! Thank you",5
1138,Great starter phone for my sons 14th birthdayEverything works as if it was brand new. The battery life is great and the Touch ID works too.,5
1139,Everything about the phone is fine. The one thing I needed most was being able to make better phone calls and that's what's wrong with it. The microphone is all static and makes it super hard to hear my voice. I need that part for my job and I'm out of money to spend on another one. Going to have to go get that part fixed. But everything else is pretty good. Nothing seems to be wrong with it besides that.,3
1140,"Good, like new condition. However, battery life was pretty low at 78%. It's alright though, because the phone is working perfectly.",5
1141,"The phone looks and feels like it’s new, the phone has a 92 battery Heath when it arrived and touch screen worked fine until I put a protective cover and it acts ups doe time I don’t know if it is the phone or it’s the  extra glass, Touch ID works better than it did on my iPhone se. I also like the water Proof it has.",5
1142,Phone is in working condition. Battery dies quickly.,3
1143,I bought this phone unlocked to use in another country! I had no problems buying and activating a SIM card and it works great! The only problem I have is that there was a scratch on it that was partially covered up with a glass cover. I didn’t like the attempt to hide this. I do not live in the US and can’t easily exchange it and I needed a phone for international use. Other than that the phone works great and I am happy with my purchase!,4
1144,Unlocked does not mean easy to activate! You must buy a sim card and fight w your service provider to activate it! You better always be home to sign for this item or you will never get it. All this and it was cheaper and easier to get from the boost store.,4
1145,"Bought an IPhone 8 unlocked for T-Mobile and I put in my sim card and it started working immediately. I’ve never had an iPhone so transferring my files was annoying and my apps didn’t transfer but w.eThe phone works, there was some damage on the bottom but I knew there would be.",5
1146,The phones came with batteries at 50% battery max capacity...another words shot! Only reason I am not sending back is because I made the mistake of pulling out the accessories and throwing the box away... Buyer beware!,1
1147,"If I could I would give this product zero stars. The phone after 3 days shut off and did not turn on again even though it was fully charged. When I went to return it, they said I had to pay restocking fees which were a lot and I only got 150 dollars back from the almost 300 dollar phone. Would not recommend.",1
1148,"Phone was a ""renewed"" phone.  In excellent condition and arrived ahead of schedule.  Battery life isn't great, but not sure that's the sellers issue.  I bought the phone to be able to face time with family and grandchildren.  I typically use an Android, but this phone does what I need it to do.  I would purchase from this seller again.",4
1149,I like that it is the same size as the 6 so I could keep the same case. I also got it with more space for business purposes,5
1150,"It's always a bit of a gamble buying a refurbished iPhone, but I have to say, the one I received looks and works like a new one. I haven't found anything on it that doesn't work like it should. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased with the purchase.",5
1151,The description said unlocked but the phone was not T-mobile or Sprint capable so I could not use. I returned the device and got Most of my money back. The device itself looked great. No dents or scratches,3
1152,"Never bought an used phone before, but am very happy I did--the price was great and I am completely satisfied with my phone, used it for a month now, also it arrived quicker than expected and looked and felt brand new. You got a customer for life now! Thank you!",5
1153,"No complaints. This refurbished iPhone 8 was like new, not a scratch on it.  Downloaded thru Bluetooth iPhone to iPhone in minutes. This is my first refurbished iPhone. I’d do it again.",5
1154,The battery life on this phone is terrible. Drains very quickly.,1
1155,"Phone works fine, but needs to constantly be charged. I had to buy extra charging cables to have one everywhere I go - kitchen, bedroom, office, both cars, on my bike, in my backpack. Kind of pathetic, but hey it’s Apple so it must be awesome.",2
1156,"I’m Loving my iPhone, I love the fingerprint reader and easy to use.",5
1157,"This phone WAS NOT fully unlocked. Suck a hassle trying to fix this issue🙃🙃🙃. Still haven’t fixed it... Condition was decent, but that was to be expected. REPEAT: THIS PHONE IS NOT FULLY UNLOCKED",2
1158,"I purchase this refurbished phone for my son and it was activated shortly after Christmas, 2018. Within a few weeks, the camera stopped taking photos. Because that wasn't important to him, my son didn't tell me about this until March.Other than the camera, the phone works fine. However, this model doesn't have a port to plug in earbuds.",2
1159,Phone didn’t lasted 3 hours... as soon as the charge got over phone didn’t charge again.I am done with used phone.,1
1160,Mine has what looks to be a couple of fingerprint smudges under the glass from when it was refurbished. Other than that annoying thing the phone works great.,4
1161,Very impressed: I received yesterday expected a view flaws it is pristine no scratches or dings. Took to my carrier for a new SIM card. i have not done a lot of web searching. I made a few phone calls connected to my car Bluetooth no problems so far. I did not rate battery life. I was surprised it came with a charge on it. Battery life is a long term comment.,2
1162,"Exactly what I ordered! Came faster than I thought too. Came with a charger, the correct carrier i wanted. 5 stars!",5
1163,So far I would give this a 0 rating. After 1 week of use the phone started randomly quit working. Of course it's out of the return period bc it was late and a gift which the receiver didnt end up using till return period was up. I have contacted seller and will update as this progresses. So far very unhappy and will not use them again.,1
1164,it says like new condition but shortly after ohone has not been working well and all kinds of glitches going on would recommend you chose someone else to buy from,1
1165,"The phone came in looking perfect, but the SIM card reader was not working.  We went to two different stores and one was a T-Mobile factory store.  They stated the screen was replaced and extremely glitchy as well as the SIM card reader is not working.",1
1166,Purchased this product for a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I took the product to have it activated and the Boost Mobile Customer Service person could not activate the product. Customer serivice told me that the Phone was most likely stolen or locked. I will be reaching out to Amazon for a refund.,1
1167,"I returned the phone already, there was a small crack in the back which it did say might be minor cosmetic wear so that’s okay I guess, but the reason I only gave one star is because I thought the phone was AT&T locked  but after talking to Apple for an hour and talking to AT&T for an hour I came to find out the phone was cricket locked and that was the reason why my SIM card wasn’t being accepted super frustrating situation to find out that was the case",1
1168,"Product looks great.  The battery goes dead in about thirty minutes of use, or about two hours with no use.  In each case, this was with a full charge.",1
1169,"Great storage. Battery doesn’t last long. Can’t use the phone unless you put it on the speaker, can’t hear it otherwise.",3
1170,I got my mom this iPhone because her old one needed a finally resting place. We got the phone with in 2 weeks and it came looking better than I excepted it to be. It was easy to set up and she loves it!,5
1171,Perfect replacement and I saved a lot. About half of what Verizon wanted,5
1172,"The product says it comes with a SIM card remover and it does not, so you will have to prepare for that. Other than minor cosmetic damage the phone runs really well! If possible would probably rate with 4.5/5 stars but it’s really not a bad product at all",5
1173,got amazing service from the company ans our grand daughter loves the phone,5
1174,The speaker and blue tooth did not work. Had to return. The return process/experience with Buyspry was easy and efficient. I decided to get a refurbished Iphone X.,4
1175,Got the product on time and just as advertised.,5
1176,Have problems with the phone most of the time,3
1177,No issues on my phoneEverything working,5
1178,I bought this phone for a relative. It works great so far.  This is our second IPhone 8 and I would say it is almost as good as my brand new one!,5
1179,"Awesome!!!  So easy to transfer from one phone to another.  I had iPhone SE, what a wonderful difference.  This phone does not looked renewed!  I would tell anyone to purchase from this seller.  Quick transaction and delivery!",5
1180,Exactly as seller stated. Beautiful phone looks brand new. Was even fully charged when arrived. Everything works perfect.,5
1181,Battery was terrible from the moment I activated it. Phone started randomly shutting off and restarting just weeks after receiving and now it’s completely gone and won’t even turn on. Not worth the investment and such a hassle and inconvenience. Would have much rather put that money towards a new one since it costs about the same between the price of the phone and now the cost to fix it.,1
1182,A little on the pricey side but it is a great phone easy to use and add or remove apps I like it. I would suggest it to others looking for a great phone.,4
1183,This phone just randomly shuts off. Smfh,1
1184,"I was under the impression that the phone was bigger , that’s why I bought it. It’s not what I expected at all . I can’t afford to send it back at this point because I can’t be without a phone. Also it took almost a month for it to arrive. Very disappointed with this whole experience. I will not buy another phone from Amazon again!",1
1185,i tried to install my sim card wouldn't work not sure if its a carrier problem the screen was scratched pretty noticeably not packaged to well phone was rattling around the box probably why it was so scratched from the screen,3
1186,The camera never worked and the phone died after  only having it for a few months. Super annoyed. They’re saying it’s “user error”!!!,1
1187,"I received my phone March 16th 2020 and it worked fine, the only thing wrong with it was the fact the volume down button didn’t work. Then as I was on Snapchat the screen just went black, it was not dead because I could use Siri but I could shit my phone down unlock it or anything. Wouldn’t recommend buying.",1
1188,I got the IPhone 8 yesterday. I am really happy with it! It looks and works like new so far.,5
1189,Easy setup and worked perfect right out of box.,5
1190,"After 5 months stopped working, WiFi no longer works, buy your phone new, this is second phone that just stopped working, cased, not a mark, probably not refurbished correctly",1
1191,Great phone! Unlocked like it said. No issues,5
1192,I bought this phone as a gift for my son. Well the phone programmed fine and I was happy with the purchase until the first day...I tried to call my son and he couldn’t answer because the screen went black. Not even 24 hours after it arrived. I was disappointed.,1
1193,Swapped out for an iPhone 6s. Worked perfectly with AT&T .,5
1194,I was skeptical if to purchase this phone after seeing some mixed reviews but I did and it was perfect! Works like brand new and came with a tempered glass on. I’ve had it for 3 months now with no complaints ! Great value for money.,5
1195,"Everything went well, but there are no headphones, and a couple of things activated. Other than that everything good and I do recommend it!",4
1196,I can’t believe Amazon would send such a horrible product the phone isn’t in the original housing it looks completely tampered with and it’s filthy there’s brown grime all around the tampered with housing and the switch to turn it from ring to vibrate it’s disgusting.  I’m so pissed,1
1197,"I'm not sure if it's the dryness of winter, but my print is being read very easily.",5
1198,Working great and amglad I did purchase it.,4
1199,beautiful color no scratches  just like new  easy to use great buy,5
1200,"This phone is in MINT condition. I must say I’m impressed. However, we’re told that we’re guaranteed a minimum of 80% battery health but this came with 79%. Disappointed. Would’ve liked if it came with a lot more than that.",3
1201,"It didn’t work, and we had to buy a different phone.",1
1202,Fingerprint reading isn’t that great but the battery life is great,5
1203,Definitely worth the purchase for the price I do not have think you will find something this cheap and appearance of the device is great,4
1204,The equipment was unlocked and worked perfectly with T-mobile.Buy and send super fast and well packaged. This seller is recommended,5
1205,Doesn’t come with the iPhone jack for headphones or aux but other than that I love it.,4
1206,Great purchase so far had over a year for a child,5
1207,"I wanted a cheaper iPhone with a lot of storage. It stinks to not have the newest version and best camera, but I love it.",5
1208,"We have been having issues with using the internet and wifi with the phone, service issues when we shouldn’t have them, and not being able to send or receive texts and calls as well",2
1209,"The phone came well packaged with no damage. My son main complaint is the phone would not keep charge for a long time. The charger has a black piece that goes to the wall. Otherwise, it looks good.",4
1210,Honestly the phone looked pretty much brand new.,5
1211,I understand this phone wasn’t brand new but expected it to be better than what it is. Finger print doesn’t work I have to enter my passcode. Speaker is terrible. When I talk to someone I can barley hear them.,1
1212,Phone works perfectly. Looked practically new.,4
1213,My iPhone8 took less that a week to arrive (4 days to be precise) on free shipping. It is a real value for money. Looks and acts like new. Battery life is at a 100%. I couldn’t have asked for anything better than this. It even came with a free screen protector! What better value can I get than that! Thank you Amazon and all the more thanks to the seller (joy goods).,5
1214,I bought this iPhone for my birthday. I was very skeptical of buying a renewed phone. But it came in basically brand new and everything working well. It came in one day earlier than the expected time and so far everything is great. Really pleased with this purchase.,5
1215,"I activated this phone a couple days ago and so far it's been what i expected. The one issue I have found is that on snapchat you have to turn the volume down, open the snap and then turn the volume back up to listen to it but this is probably an issue with snapchat rather then the phone. Would recommend.",4
1216,Got this phone for my wife to take a chance and it's working so great. Decided to buy another phone for myself. I would definitely but from this buyer if you are looking for a great phone. Super fast shipping as well,5
1217,It was in super great condition felt like it was (new) even though it was renewed the packing was alright. Phone came in fully charged and factory reset the battery life was at 90% which wasn't a big deal again this was a renewed iphone 8 super happy with the price and the condition,5
1218,Charging cord that it came with didn't work after a week and still have problems charging with the right cords sometimes,4
1219,"Sorry for my first review I mistook you for the other charlatans! Great doing serious business with you. Prompt, great quality and trustworthy! Completely satisfied nothing like the seller before this!",5
1220,"Phone works as expected, no problem adding it to my Verizon contract line, and it was in like new condition.",4
1221,"Great phone for the price. This is my first iPhone and didn’t want to pay a lot of money if I hated it. Works great, great condition, great battery life. Would buy from this seller again!",5
1222,Phone itself works pretty well! I love the large storage! Sometimes the phone does lag when changing from the phone’s Home page to other apps and it’s can’t be the internet I don’t think. Also this phone does not have a built in phone jack which is annoying but I think that’s what’s on the tin. All in all 👌✨,4
1223,"The phone is wonderful. Arrived with no noteworthy scratches and unfortunately, and battery life of 79%, one percent less than what an Amazon renewed product is required to have. That being said, it’s one percent. That being said, if I wanted to buy a phone with a bum battery, I would’ve done it for less than the what I paid.",2
1224,"I bought the phone in November, only 3 months ago and it has now went out. The phone won’t even turn on at all. I am not pleased with this faulty product.",1
1225,Purchased for a gift and the recipient was happy,5
1226,Very disappointing! The battery has about half an hour of life. The phone is borderline inoperable. Now I need to get a new battery.I’d recommend buying a phone from these people if you’d like to waste time and money on a new project. Buying the phone is basically like paying money to be deal with problems.,1
1227,This device arrived as advertised. It looks just let me new and works great,5
1228,"Be warned. Depending on where your phone was made or distributed to, you may have privacy features installed on the phone where you may not do things like take a photo without the shutter clicking. Please check your serial number to see where your phone is made.",2
1229,"Great phone, exactly what I wanted. Also very fast shipping. Phone works perfectly and packaging was very protective. Worked with my Net10 sim from my iPhone 6plus. Very happy with this product.",5
1230,I was delivered the wrong color of the phone. Ordered gold and received rose gold. This refurbished phone has a very bad battery life. Was hoping for a better product. Have to replace bater now. Very disappointed.,2
1231,It actually a very great phone!,5
1232,"The back camera doesn’t work, there was scratches all over the back, and the speakerphone won’t work most of the time. I get that it was refurbished but I just bought one a year ago and it looked brand new.",3
1233,I have had no problems with this phone,4
1234,Tried to contact company with no response so had to go to apple and you know what that like. Problem got fixed without the help from company,4
1235,"In very good shape, works well, great price.",5
1236,"it did not charge correctly. took hours to charge and only when totally off. if i had it on, or using any app even when plugged in it would lose it's charge. so obviously the 3rd party seller (tech exchange) did NOT totally check this product before selling it.it was a hassle to get reimbursed even after i sent it back.",1
1237,This item was purchased as a gift. The recipient of this gift returned the item because after the SIM card was installed in the iPhone glitches.,2
1238,Looks brand new. Very low battery life. Very disappointed.,3
1239,The phone has 100% battery life and zero scratches/marks. The phone is perfect for my 7 yr old.,5
1240,Everything worked perfect,5
1241,Finally got my husband switched over to a iPhone.,5
1242,Sold me a broken phone then charged me a restocking fee so I didn’t even get all my money back,1
1243,I got exactly what was advertised it works great and battery is like new,5
1244,The packaging was great and the phone itself is in good working order and condition at this time.  So far so good !,5
1245,"Has been in use, I feel the appearance is 90% new, still good, the screen, the speed of operation, standby time is not bad, recommended to buy, or even guaranteed, if you can give a screen protector and protective cover, it is better",4
1246,"For $300, I cannot imagine the quality getting any better. Charging port is functioning, touch screen is flawless, and fingerprint reader hasn’t messed up once. Battery life is a tad bit worse than I expected, but that’s the only complaint. Set up and put in my Verizon SIM card and it was ready to go.",5
1247,This phone was ok for about 2 weeks then it started to reboot on its own. I could be on a call & it turns off by itself. I’m not happy at all & have to wait to save money for a new one which I won’t be getting on Amazon that’s for sure... Hate hate hate it.,1
1248,"Perfect, I finally convinced my 80 year old grandma to switch to iPhone and she liked the color and how easy it is to use!",5
1249,When I got the phone the battery life was 67% wasted of money took it to Apple for a battery replacement. Wasted of money and time. The home bottom sometimes works and sometime doesn’t work.,1
1250,These refurbished phones cost way to much to be in the condition that they are. The iPhone 8 I bout looked almost brand new but the battery life is horrible and the volume button doesn’t work. Now I have to go through the hassle of waiting on a refund with no phone. Don’t waste your money.,5
1251,This phone looked all new untill I went to use it the battery was no good and the phone is junk please do not buy from this place don't waste your money in such time of need your better off with no iPhone then this one I'll never buy a single item from this seller believe the reviews I should have do not buy this phone please,1
1252,Phone works well. Pleased with my purchased.,5
1253,Arrived early and works fantastic!!! Thank you!!!,5
1254,I find no issues other than battery life. Fairly good for the given price,4
1255,"It is great with many features, some of which I have not used yet.  Still learning, but satisfied so far.",4
1256,I want to like this product but the calibration or something is messed up because the camera constantly shakes. I cannot take pictures because all of them shake and come out slightly blurry. Also the screen is so sensitive even when the screen is locked. I end up taking pictures while it is in my pocket. The only thing I am blaming the renewal team is the camera. The sensitive screen maybe just on me idk,3
1257,I finally got this iPhone after so many years with an Samsung I made the decision to make a change and I didn’t regret I love it and I love the way it works,5
1258,Perfect atleast to me it’s an iPhone 8 so it’s not the newest but still newer then my last phone I will definitely buy from them again when it’s time for a new phone or upgrade!,5
1259,Phone arrived as described and had my Metro PCS store turn it on to their network.,5
1260,"My iPhone arrived and it is a beauty... took it to AT&T to get it activated. They just swapped the sim cards between my old 5C and the new phone. Presto, with a bit of standard formatting, I'm up and running. I love this phone!",5
1261,Packaging was great. No dings or damage to the phone. Satisfied with shipping. It just came with the phone and charger.  Great phone for the price.  Recommend to anyone for a budget phone.,5
1262,I’m not sure if it’s all phones like this or just mine. But it is incredibly difficult to use. The touch screen barely recognizes my fingers. It takes a LOT of effort and patience to get the control center (swipe up from home button) to work.,3
1263,Very nice. Like new. Well package and sealed,5
1264,"Was not compatible with sprint, t mobile network.Description said compatible with all networks,  sprint , t mobile were listed.Very disappointed!Was a surprise birthday gift for daughter.Not anymore!Gave it one star because everything else was great!Wished it turned out differently.",1
1265,I purchased this refurbished iPhone 8 and everything works perfectly fine! Only light scratches i seen! But everything else finger code and the phone itself works fine!! Battery is fine as well!!! Thank You!!,5
1266,"Though the battery life was lower than expected, for the price this phone has been great. No other issues. No scratches, cracks, or dings. Works with Verizon (I had my doubts that it was compatible and previous comments were inconsistent.)",4
1267,"My sister and I pitched in to get this for my brother to replace his ""iPhone 2-"" jkjk... iPhone 5s, but still!",5
1268,Great phone came in just in time,4
1269,"loses the signal and turns off alone, so you can not use the phone, I do not recommend",1
1270,The phone arrived well packaged on time and in perfect condition. Even on very close inspection I couldn't find  any flaws at all. It's like a new phone. The packaging was better than I expected and the phone was well protected. I couldn't be happier with the purchase.,5
1271,Great replacement phone for my 11 year old. Came with a charger and earbuds.,5
1272,"I was ridiculously nervous, buying this phone online, but to my excitement and relief, it works perfectly! The battery life is pretty good, nowhere near as bad as my last phone was, and the phone as a whole is in good condition. It also receives signal way more easily than my last phone, which is great, I wasn't expecting that.",5
1273,I know I wasgetting a refurbished phone but I didn't expect scratches on the screen when it came out of the box.,4
1274,"The phone was evwrything I needed it to be. It was super easy to activate and I had no issues doing so. It was a Christmas present for my 11 year old, which upgraded her from a 6S+ to an 8. The number one thing on her list. And she is EXTREMELY haopy about her ""new"" phone!!",5
1275,"Noticed the screen was coming loose. Decided to open the phone to reset the screen only to find multiple screws loose inside. A total of 6 screws, different sizes, were lose inside the phone. It is missing the metal plates to protect the battery connections and screen display connections.",3
1276,"This phone is in good condition. The fingerprint reader and battery life are both good. It could’ve been cleaned better though. Also, would’ve helped to have an actual iPhone charger box and cord instead of a knockoff.",5
1277,Bought this for my husband for our anniversary. I works great and he loves it!,5
1278,This seller literally sent me a phone with a microphone that does not work. I just took it out of the box to put my SIM card in & made a test call. Well everyone that I tried calling could barely hear me on the other end. They stated it sounded like I was whispering despite me speaking very loudly. Don’t waste your time. You will be disappointed.,1
1279,Hi I think the original owner lock my phone I bought from Amazon I think one of you guys need  Unlock my phone back it say iPhone is disabledI try my Password and fingerprint still not working iPhone is disabledWhen I bought it say factory unlocked,4
1280,I read of the comments a lot of the people giving this guy a bedtime whatever but this phone is perfect out the box on a scratch on it Sim card through it right in running the latest software it’s good it’s good buy and good phoneBut if you could already have another phone to build off of it it be great not an android and iPhone,4
1281,Looks like new my lady friend loves it,5
1282,"I dont want to send it back, great price for i, but it only vibrates! It wont play music when i get a text or phone call!! Im rather irritated! Do i have a warranty to go to apply store for them to fix it or do i need to mail it back? If i have to mail it back Im going to be more irriated for paying all i did to my cell phone carrier for the hook up first month and activation fee!!",2
1283,"To keep it a buck, the phone is top-tier and it was money well spent. I was able to go to a cell phone provider and get it activated with no hassle whatsoever.",5
1284,"Battery life is terrible, just 3-4 hours.",3
1285,"Daughter loved it, works, and charges.",5
1286,"Phone was initially operating well, but within 5 months would not hold a charge or recognize the charging cable. Not worth the risk as warranty only covers 90 days. Better off spending a bit more and buying new.",1
1287,Everything that I was expecting. Pretty brand new condition. Battery is good. Functions flawlessly. No complaints. A bit relieved after reading some of the other comments. I’m happy with mine.,5
1288,I had low expectations as this was going to be a used phone. But the quality of the phone was very good. Just like new. In fact my daughter thinks it’s new phone.,5
1289,"No issues, quick shipping and works great!",5
1290,"phone was in a perfect condition (renewied) besides the main issue with the battery life and reason why I returned, battery was charging slow and draining fast.comunication with seller was nice and smooth, refund was fast. excellent transaction.If the battery had been in good condition, I would have given them 5 stars.",3
1291,great phone works really well,5
1292,"Its good but for some reason 1 out of the 2 I bought just turned off on me within 2 months and hasn't turned back on, Idk what to say but I wish I could get my money back",4
1293,I’ve had a 5s forever. This was an awesome upgrade. Arrived fast. Thanks.,5
1294,The title itself says it’s “fully unlocked” but when I tried connecting it to a certain carrier it wouldn’t let me. I’d be more careful buying from this seller.,2
1295,"After reading some negative reviews, I was a bit skeptical. I went with my gut and purchased the phone. I do have to say that for the price, this phone is amazing. Mine looks brand new with no damage on the front or back apart from small paint chipping. It charges fine and lasts the normal time. Setup is fine and when i put in my tmobile sim it worked in seconds",5
1296,Battery life is terrible constant problems with the phone,3
1297,"Battery life 92%, barely had any scratches, came with a glass screen protector on already, but the second one I ordered didn’t have it on, it came in the box. Overall good phone , it was time for an upgrade",5
1298,"I didn’t like it, I also had to give it to my 7 y/o because no phone company would activate it. The person selling it never got back to me. It was a wasted $187",1
1299,"I have had this iPhone for about 3 weeks. There were no marks, scuffs or scratches on it at all. Transferring data from my other phone to this one was pretty easy. The phone works great with long battery life and is much faster than my other iPhone.",5
1300,No charge in battery and wouldn’t take a charge. Returned for credit,1
1301,I purchased the Iphone 8 for my wife.  So far it has exceeded all expectations.,4
1302,Just like new and I can’t tell it is not. Very good service from seller. Very satisfied with IPhone. Thanks to seller for saving a retiree some $’s with this like new IPhone.,5
1303,The product looked good with few scratches. The battery health was on 84% which was disappointing. My reason for sending it back is that the headphone jack did not work.,1
1304,"I bought this with some skepticism but was pleasantly surprised. The maximum capacity was marked at 88% when I checked, but it charges to 100% so I’m thinking it’s a small glitch. Everything works the way it was supposed to though. So far, anyway. It did come to me with a BUNCH of minor scratches.",4
1305,When I first opened it it looked fine but then I went to turn it on and it took like an hour to even get it on. After that I went to charge the phone and it says it's on 1 percent all the time and when I have it on the charger it doesn't do anything and I've tried with 2 chargers. I'm debating on whether I should pay to fix it or just return the phone because it's so impractical and doesn't work even close to right.,1
1306,Excelente equipo! Tiene una calidad superior a la esperada. Muy recomendable!,5
1307,Phone was either not unlocked or was broken.  SIM card was not recognized even though it should have worked.  Very disappointing.  Return was easy but it would have been nice if they had tested the phone before sending it to me.  grrrrr.....,1
1308,Thus far I am satisfied with this refurbished product,5
1309,Great budget iPhone that still works great! And the renewed iPhone 8 I got was in great condition and even still has AppleCare warranty from the previous owner!I’d say worth it!,5
1310,I like the phone for the price. Everything was new and I had no problems transferring my data over. I will have this phone for a couple of years.,5
1311,Purchased as a replacement for my son's older IPhone6. It looks and performs just like a brand new one and he is completely satisfied.,5
1312,The phone is in great condition and works good.,5
1313,This is my second refurb without any problems.,5
1314,The phone came in excellent condition no scratches or anything. However the charger port stopped working a month late thank god for wireless chargers because this is the only way it will charge now.,3
1315,"I ordered a unlock iPhone and that’s what I got! It works great! It’s a brand new phone! Some of the other reviews scared me, but none of the described what I got! It’s a brand new phone and works great! It also came with a screen protector already on it, so that’s awesome too!",5
1316,Amazing! It's like new. Really impressed and these guys deserve a good review.,5
1317,"Do not buy this phone. It made it just past 90 days so I couldn't return it and now it doesn't work. I thought it was the SIM card, so I spent hours and days getting a replacement for that. Still doesn't work. So will have to purchase a new phone.",1
1318,"The iPhone was sent without a complete charger, only a cable, but not the power supply that plugs into 110 volt wall socket.  My email reporting this problem was not satisfactorily answered .  I am using a charger from another iPhone now .When I ordered this iPhone I reasonably expected it to be complete.",1
1319,El hipone está muy lindo sólo tengo un problema con la carga que no aguanta y me parece que hice una mala inversión 111😡,2
1320,Really nice phone almost new,5

1324,Works just as expected.  Great phone and a great seller.  Highly recommended.,5
1325,"A good used phone for the $$. Did not come with original charge block. In fact it came with an LG charge block. Other than that, it’s fantastic. Would have liked some apple stickers but that’s just being too picky. 😜",5
1326,"It was great packaging with a charger and a chord. Very clean. Gave a feeling of new purchase.What I didn't like:  When opened, battery was almost at 0%.  There was no indication that the phone was GCM unlocked. (I had purchased GCM unlocked).",5
1327,"I spent $200+ for a phone that doesn't even work, said it was stolen or that they want me to pay it off, don't trust this company or what they sell, it's NEVER worth it.",1
1328,Do not buy this.,1
1329,"My phone broke so I bough this one to get a quick replacement that's affordable. But I the camera does not work. It will open up and show what you're trying to take a picture of for a few seconds and then freeze and go black. Don't waste your money, chances are your will have something broken as well.",1
1330,The product sold I got a phone that was purchase in japan! Apple told me to get total refund ! Why the hell you sell things from out the states !,1
1331,minimal side scratches clear perfect screen worked with my verizon carrier and battery is more like at a 70% but still works really good for it’s price :),5
1332,Brought this phone for my son and he loved it. It was red with no scratches pretty much like new. The phone had better updates vs his older iPhone he was able to do a lot more on his iPhone 8,5
1333,"Maybe I'm lucky but this phone arrived in perfect condition, exactly as described.  I bought it for my wife whos iPhone 6 was failing.  We inserted her SIM card and she was up and running.  I charged it the night before so we'll see how the battery lasts but so far so good.",5
1334,I was hesitant to buy this for my niece but she loves it the phone works great! we have no complaints.,4
1335,"Excellent phone.  Like new.  Didn’t look used at all.  Came with glass screen protector installed, nice touch.",5
1336,"Purchased for trade in, couldn’t get a credit for either one both phones had defective screens. Screens not cracked just weren’t working properly per cellular provider notes , Trade in program would not send back total loss so do not purchase from this seller.",1
1337,"The Battery to the phone I  purchased was damaged, it had a glitch in the battery and it was turning off whenever I tried to do something without it on the charger.Then it’s started saying its unable to determine the battery charge percentage, meaning it’s dead regardless of it being all charge for a long time.I will send my phone back, get my money back and be done with the whole thing.",1
1338,Was hesitant to get this after reading some negative reviews. Purposely waited a couple months to see how it did. Seems like a brand new phone. Has worked flawlessly.,5
1339,"the phone came with the battery very bad to change it, very hit and sticky",1
1340,He hasn’t used face recognition or the finger print reader ( he resists technology) lol. Battery life is good.,5
1341,"The phone is fine but I paid extra for it to be shipped on a Tuesday and it got here Thursday afternoon. The battery after being fully charged lasted about 5 hours. My previous Galaxy phone’s battery lasted me all day, so...Idk I haven’t owned an I phone in so long I can’t compare it to other iphones. I am still getting used to it.",3
1342,On the box that I got it said NEW so idk if it’s really new but it came in perfect shape. Like it actually was brand new . Overall the phone is great and the battery percentage thingy it said that It was %100. I love my phone and I do recommend🙃,5
1343,"I purchased this phone thinking it would come unlocked as they stated, only to try an active and to be told phone is locked. I reached out to the seller and they want me to print shipping label and take to UPS drop off. This is not fair at all",1
1344,works well no issues like new,5
1345,Phone was delivered on time. Miner scuffs on the screen. It’s to be expected. Decent charging cable. Phone was packaged well. Over all I’m happy,4

1353,"I received my phone about 10 days ago. The ear speaker it too quiet to hear out of so I’ve been having to always call with headphones. Also when you record a video the playback sound is choppy it cuts in and out. This phone is clearly broken, I just inquired about a exchange, or repair. Hope they respond, my alternate email nataliepeightel@icloud.com my phone number (813)468-7633",2
1354,"This is the second refurbished phone I bought in Amazon. Both have been perfect. No scratches and no problem with functionality. I know there is always a risk, but for the moment, they have worked very well for me.",5
1355,So I got the phone today it was totally unlocked so I was able to connect with metro pcs right away was annoyed that it was completely dead but small fix. Phone has no damages or cosmetic issues in very pleased and happy good buy,5
1356,"You could tell this phone was kept in a case for a long time, due to *very minor* scratches. The phones battery health was at 90% which I think is great for a renewed product. This phone has definitely exceeded my expectations.",5
1357,Good phone didn’t notice any blemishes bought for my daughter as a starter phone battery is good everything works even came with a screen protector,5
1358,This product looked new. Started having a glich from day one. Reset it a couple times. It continued to freeze. Then the screen turned black.  Wouldn't do anything. Sent back waiting on refund.,2
1359,Battery charge is not as long as it should be. iCloud storage seems to be limited.,5
1360,It just wont charge anymore ive tried different chargers and different outlets it wont charge.,1
1361,Almost Didn't purchase this phone  based on some reviews.but so far it's working great...Look brand new.. got it earlier than the original delivery date. N it came unlockedWill update if anything,4
1362,Honestly was scared to buy this phone not knowing anything about if it would work with a government sim and it did.,5
1363,"This is one of those STUPID phones made for Japan, where you cannot disable the camera shutter sound!!! I am so ANGRY!!! They don't tell you this in advance. So frustrating!!!",1
1364,Came in way earlier than what was initially stated which was a nice surprise!No scratches and phone looks great. The charger is not from Apple and did not come with headphone adapter.Overall everything was good!,5
1365,"Phone originated from japan which means that the camera shutter is always on, other than that it was an all right phone. I am getting a replacement in the next few days if that one also has the Japan problem I will return it and update my review here.Update: Received another Japanese phone, very disappointed. Do not buy this unless you want your phone to blast the camera shutter noise when you take a photo.",1
1366,"First time iphone buyer and user. Good product. Worked coming out of the box. Quick and easy setup. Good battery life. Could use a little cleaning but overall still good in great condition. If you're going for a cheaper option then the latest generation of iphone, I would say this would be a great buy.",4
1367,"This phone was supposed to be fully unlocked, and it is not according to a mobile company that we are using. This is so emotionally embarrassing because we purchased it for our daughter who was 12 now 13 Christmas and birthday present. Now we will probably have to pay extra to have it unlocked if it can be.",2
1368,"I ordered the phone on Saturday and it arrived on Thursday which was very fast! When it it arrived, I took it out of the package and was amazed that it was in almost new condition it was a slight scuff on the bottom, but it wasn’t a deal breaker for me. It’s working perfectly right now and the battery life is amazing! I definitely recommend.",5
1369,My husband had a 6 so he loves the iPhone 8. He like the price even better.,5
1370,"The phone itself was good, it came with a scratch or two so I decided why not return it and try my luck with ordering it again.  I returned it and still waiting for my refund. Absolutely ridiculous!!! I have waited 3 weeks for s phone and now we dont even know if we will get out 200 dollars back !!!!!",1
1371,100% functional almost a year later. I would absolutely buy again from this seller.,5
1372,Co. would not honor any guarantee,1
1373,Got it for a friend,5
1374,Perfect. Great price. Quality phone... So far very good.,5
1375,"I am returning the phone because it won't turn on, please contact me on when you will send me a new one or return the money I spent",1
1376,The phone I received is NOT compatible with all carriers as advertised. I have to send it back to find one that actually works for Sprint.,1

1378,So far so good. Son is happy with it.,5
1379,Muy buen producto cumplió mis expectativas,5
1380,"This item was horrible, 2 weeks after buying it I am having to send it to the warranty company and am getting charged a 29.00 fee. The glass on the face of the phone has been crumbling off in shards, like a Dead Sea scroll that was unearthed.Save yourself the trouble and get a new iPhone.",1
1381,Excellent product. I would definitely buy from this vendor again.,5
1382,Everything's good so far 👍,4
1383,"We were very disappointed in this purchase. The phone is fine cosmetically, but you can't hear when talking on the phone. You have to always use headphones with it. I got it for my husband because my iPhone 8 works so well.",1
1384,"Working like rock, great pick. Works amazing. Very minimal wear which is expected.",5
1385,"Bothers me that it says ""Remanufactured by Valutech"" on the back. At least put an accurate image on the product page.",4
1386,I’m very pleased with the phone,5
1387,It was locked by an IBM program. Can’t used so I called the third party number and they said they were going to send me a new one. Haven’t gotten it or a tracking number. Left without a working phone for the holidays really sucks!,1
1388,"Like new!!! 97% battery life, not a single scratch... in my experience, fully recommended.",5
1389,Perfect phone for money spent,4
1390,"This phone was for a family member - their 6s was on its last leg, but they didn’t require the latest technology (or the price tag that goes with it). I’m glad I took a chance on the refurb - the phone works great! It looked new when I took it out of the box, and I had no issues with swapping out the SIM card from the old phone and getting it up and running. A great buy!",5
1391,"This phone has a blown speaker, and possible faulty logic board.  The sound is horrible.  How could you sell a device without troubleshooting the hardware?  Now my wife and myself are disappointed by this experience.",1
1392,This good iPhone,3
1393,Excelente vale la pena,5
1394,As described. Great quality. No obvious scratches.  Battery at 88%,5
1395,Looks brand new!,5
1396,"Aesthetically the phone looks great, however there were some issues with the microphone. The phone is refurbished so I didn’t expect it to be perfect, but it’s been a struggle to make calls/record videos/ect. Would definitely be worth the money if it fully worked.",2
1397,seems to be working ok. as of now.,5
1398,Very good price but in amazon better price!!,5
1399,I liked everything!,5
1400,The item was defective. The touch screen stopped working after I was restoring the phone. They don’t want to give a full refund. They want me to give them my apple passcode to factory reset the phone. There is no way I’m giving them my apple code. They gotta be crazy.,1
1401,Can see lot of scratches on front and back and battery life is at 88% and generic packing and no headphones either and generic cable.,2
1402,The phone is are but it have a problem of microphone,3
1403,"Don’t buy from that seller, product is so bad it’s not worth the money",1
1404,Great phone for the price,5
1405,There was a minor error with the delivery. Showed it was delivered on the 3rd of this month but came on the 5th. (Assuming because of Easter weekend) Otherwise iphone performs like a brand new device. Battery life is great & came with everything that was expected.,5
1406,I thought the phone was a great purchase until I tried to use the camera and it would not focus. All the videos and pictures are blurry. I’m taking the phone in to have the camera replaced. I get it’s refurbished but I expected it to work properly.,5
1407,Great product.,5
1408,"This phone was for my mother. We got it for her after suffering a stroke. She loves the ease of use, facial recognition, battery life and the voice commands. This has been a blessing for her to keep in touch during her hospital stay!",5
1409,Just got it today. Everything looks great so far. Working as intended. I will update at a later time if I remember.,4
1410,"Id like to know what exactly your talking about: I just got a message from amazon saying my return will be $50.00. I paid $279.9 plus taxes. This does not work for me. So, minus shipping cost to send back, I expect a full refund. Or I will  give you 1 star rating. Nothing wrong with the phone but I was too small to see it. When I get a full refund, I will give 5 stars",1
1411,"Lo compre para mi sobrina y todo funciona muy bien, solo que el face recognition no lo a usado ella . Por todo lo demás excelente condición por el precio . Gracias",5
1412,Phone was in new condition. Everything worked as advertised. Very happy with purchase.,5
1413,Very pleased with my purchase so far. Battery life is excellent.,5

1416,"Por favor su ayuda, el celular que les compre  enciende pero no se ve nada en la pantalla.Es una pena que hago...Lo lleve a la tienda de aqui y me quieren cobrar 30 solo para revisarlo... por favor diganme que hago? Como hago?",1
1417,The mic doesn’t work and my mom has to use it with headphones in order to talk in the phone.,4
1418,Overall a solid buy. Some minor volume and brightness issues but overall a good value.,4
1419,This is a good phone.,5
1420,"Working good, no problems",5
1421,This was a gift for my grandson and he is very happy with it.I Have heard nothing about any issues.,5
1422,"Was unable to activate, AT&T reports that the phone was reported as stolen by previous owner............",1
1423,This phone fills my needs well.,5
1424,Worked great!,5
1425,I’ve tried to contact the seller since receiving this phone and they won’t respond. The phone is slow the phone just randomly shuts off and takes for ever to come back on and when it does come on it has no service you then I have to restart it again. Defiantly not satisfied. We could have fix this issue but the seller will not contact me.,2
1426,"Received the phone today, it looks new, shiny, pretty and red.  I went and got a SIM card from Walmart came home and set it up in about 20 minutes and it’s been good since. No complaints and the battery life is 88%.",4

1434,Not sure it’s been 3 days however it arrived in time with no scratches on it an looked new... it’s to early to confirm if it is mechanically sound .. so far so good,4
1435,"The phone shipped and arrived super fast ! First couple days phone worked like new !! Then the screen started glitching, freezing and then ultimately stopped working after only 3 weeks of activating! I’ve tried everything from resetting to charging but just a dead black screen",1
1436,I’m satisfied with my phone! Had a few issues with the phone freezing up & getting stuck a few times but now it’s moving okay.,4
1437,"Fine for the price.I'm happy with it.  The battery lasts about 8 hours though. I used to have an Android, which can last about twice longer.",4
1438,"This product was in excellent condition. I cannot believe how long the battery stays charged, which was my primary reason for getting another phone.  My old phone also had fingerprint recognition, and this one also works excellently in that regard.",5
1439,Very pleased,5
1440,"I was trepidatious to make this purchase because there’s no way to tell the quality of the phone before you get it, but I risked it and got the biscuit. The phone I recieved was absolutely perfect.",5
1441,"Your description of this iPhone 8 being compatible with all carriers is inaccurate. US Cellular does not recognize this phone. Due to the description you have provided for this product, You are committing fraud and promoting false advertisement.",1
1442,"As described, sealed in vacuum bag, very carefully surrounded by protection bags. Comes with charger adaptor and usb cable. Fully unlocked, very pleased wit the order. I would recommend.",5
1443,works like it says,4
1444,Buen celular,5

1446,Excelente,5
1447,Portable size.,5
1448,Everything OK,5
1449,Great phone,5
1450,"The phone that showed up had no scratches or the look of even soft usage. Battery runs all day, it feels like a phone right out of the apple box.My only complaint is the charging box was broken.",4
1451,No single charger plug was damaged,1
1452,I had a terrible iphone 6 that I hung on to for to long.  Purchased this refurbished iPhone8  and am so happy!! Looks brand new and operates like new.  Love the long battery life.  Highly recommend.,5
1453,I didn't like that it didn't come with a sim card now I have to go to the store to purchase one.,4
1454,"After 5 months the battery is draining sharply without even being used, no apps open, battery saver mode on, wasn't even dropped once.",1
1455,Phone doesn’t come with facial recognition. Battery life isn’t the best and definitely not like a new phone. Have to put in password more than I used to due to the fingerprint scanner not working all the time. Overall a good working phone tho worth 4 stars,4
1456,"El teléfono se recibió en buenas condiciones, pero tuvimos que comprar un cargador nuevo porque el que trajo no servía.",3
1457,iPhone 8 did not work. I took to t mobile and they said my SIM card was fine. Took to apple store and they said was probably a bad antenna. $350 to fix. I sent it back asking for a full refund.we will see what happens.,1
1458,So far so good works great no issues at all!,5
1459,I seriously love this phone! I was impressed with the quality provided at such a low price. The phone works like new except for the battery which seems to die slightly faster than expected. Perhaps the previous owner kept leaving the phone charged overnight.Always unplug your phones once you see 100% battery!! :),4
1460,My son loved his phone works great with t mobile,5
1461,"Ordered AT&T Apple refurbish phone, they sent me another severer I phone.  Not compatible with other AT & T phones, couldn't retrieve all of previous info from old phone.Didn't get what I wanted.",3
1462,thanks,4
1463,"Camera was not working properly,I charged it fully and turned on the day i received package. camera screen is shaking while focusing, Had scratch on back side of phone.Disappointed with the service.",1
1464,"I returned this phone because it was impossible to turn off a very loud and obnoxious shutter sound for the camera, even when the rest of the phone was on silent or vibrate.  Apparently phones that were originally sold in Japan or Korea have camera noises that are impossible to disable.  It was too annoying to keep.",2
1465,Love it,5
1466,"El producto venía en muy buenas condiciones, funcionando al 100% y hasta con una mica para proteger la pantalla que venía instalada.Mi única observación es que el auricular para hablar por teléfono venía con una capa de tierra adherida que tuve que remover para poder escuchar bien las llamadas, pero era solamente un tema de limpieza más que de funcionalidad.",5
1467,I received my package on time. However the phone didn’t work at all and wasn’t unlocked. I sent it back and they told me I sent them a different device (WHICH IS UNTRUE) DO NOT BUY OR WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE,1
1468,So far so good! Arrived quickly.,5
1469,I was nervous to buy a used phone on here because of some of the other reviews but I was very pleasantly surprised. The phone looks almost brand new (a few tiny scratches on the screen but nothing crazy)! The battery life is at 94% as well. Very happy with my purchase.,5
1470,Todavía. O lo utilicé,5
1471,So far so good! I bought this for my brother’s birthday and he loves it. So definitely a good purchase!,5
1472,Refurbished phone but battery is only at 85%I wasted my money ...,2
1473,"Package arrived as advertised: phone, charger cord and charger block. Upon first inspection the phone appears as good as new. No physical marks of any sort. Only thing that didn’t work was the left speaker, didn’t bother me though. The battery health is only at 85% but eh. Don’t really care. Overall this phone is in good shape.",4
1474,I liked this product. Noting wrong with the cell phone would order one again if I had too.,5
1475,Awesome phone.,5
1476,Bought a refurbished iPhone 8.  It worked for 4.5 months before it was no good anymore. Beware!!,1
1477,"This is the second phone bought here. The first one came with a big crack in the screen. We returned it and purchased another one. The second one would not hold a battery charge. After charging and it saying it was 100% charged it would die after we unplugged it. I am grateful the seller has let me return both products, but disappointed neither worked out.",1
1478,Amazing phone! Probably one of the better iPhones I have had. Love the red color and the size. Worth the money!,5
1479,Ordered 2 one was locked the other was unlocked 256gb worked fine with me so far had to return the 64gb due to it being locked still,3
1480,"I received a phone within days of ordering and it looked great.  However, it wasn't fully unlocked as advertised and I couldn't set it up on my Verizon account.  I will try again, but order a phone that says it's compatible with Verizon.",1
1481,Thank you,5
1482,"I bought my refurbished iPhone 8 towards the end of February of 2020.I recently started having problems with the camera hardware. I ran a diagnostics test over the phone with Apple Support, what happened is not my fault at all.Now I have no working camera and am look at roughly $300 to have it fixed at an Apple Store.Ugh.",3
1483,"This is amazing! Literally like I just bought it brand new. It is amazing, no glitches and works like an absolute dream 😍 Will definitely go through this seller again if necessary",5
1484,"The phone sold to me was faulty and was repaired in such a way to hide it from the buyer. The battery was faulty and the phone would randomly restart, making normal use impossible. I contacted the seller (Woo) about the issue and they refused to help or take the phone back. Luckily Amazon is great and took it back and refunded me.",1
1485,"perfect condition, great battery, like new",5
1486,Everything works to specs and descriptions,5
1487,"This product came SO fast! It was supposed to come Wednesday the 30th but came yesterday, Sunday the 27th! There were no scratches or physical issues with the phone-the battery was a little low, but it came with an excellent long charger!",5
1488,i received a defective product(the microphone didnt work) and the company i bought it from through amazon was very difficult to work with. i finally called amazon and received a refund with out any problems,1
1489,I was worried about buying a refurbished phone but I'm so glad I did. I have been using it for two days now. The battery  lasts the day and charges with no problem at night. All the functions are in working order and the phone looks brand-new. I love this phone and I love that I didn't have to sign a contract or pay an insane amount for a new phone.,5
1490,"Phone in perfect condition, battery condition 93%, phone looks brand new, had no problem activating with sprint.  Highly recommended!",5

1493,It’s a good phone,5
1494,"Although the iPhone did not come in traditional Apple packaging, rest assured that it is the real deal. I have had no problems with mine and am glad I saves a few hundred dollars buying a refurbished phone.",5
1495,I ordered this phone and initially loved it! But after just 2 weeks it has completely died! The screen just went completely black and nothing will work. Apple says it will cost another $450 to fix and the seller is unresponsive. Absolutely terrible experience!,1
1496,"The screen bottom is not working,, to hurt to press it.  I can not return it, because I am living for now out of the country, the  product is not in good shape. I now it is not a brand new phone, but is a pain to use the screen bottom.",1
1497,"I'm using this product in Ecuador and works great, the phone came with no scratches at all, it's completely like a new phone. I had no problem with Sim card, it came unlocked. I recommend this product!!!",5
1498,"This phone is typically clean exterior, it's not renovated I got the phone and the battery is damaged don't charge more than 50% I lost the money.. Don't waste your money here pay little more for something certificated....",1
1499,Its feel like brand new. Awesome 👍,5
1500,The only thing I didn’t like was that it came in late because of the bad weather in New York . I was expecting it two days and it came in on March 1st . I ordered it on Feb 18th and I was supposed to get it the 20th.  Anyway worth the wait . NO CRACKS !! Packaged great .,5
1501,It’s seem Brand new iPhone 8 to me,5
1502,So far so good might edit later if something goes wrong but product is good out the box.,5
1503,The phone outfit is good but the speaker condition is very bad . i can not hear anything,1
1504,This iPhone 8 came in brand new condition and worked perfectly from the moment I turned it on. 5 stars!,5
1505,"The phone is great. It looks brand new from the front and back, Everything looks good so far the only issue is that it came with 88% batter health but overall for a refurbished device this a great buy. I was actually a little skeptical at first because of the reviews but I still ordered and I’m glad I did!",4
1506,He said this is the best phone for him at any price.(Later Apple phones did stupid things like remove the home key),5
1507,"Dislike that Apple holds a tight grip - cannot use WhatsApp backup from an Android phone; or anything Google for that matter.  Fewer people would consider switching from Android phone to iPhone because of this.  (However, Five Stars for the Seller!)",4
1508,Phone looked like new and worked great.,5
1509,The battery ran down during dsy and to be recharged during the day.,4
1510,Battery life was the worst when i got it was at 72% battery health when you buy a phone you should always get 100% but this helped me get my iphone 12 so the phone was great shape and did its part just wish I didn’t have to charge it everywhere i went,1
1511,needed an update and this phone filled my needs,5
1512,Ngl yo I was scared to buy this phone at first cause of all the bad reviews I was seeing but then I ordered it and it came and I was shocked like this shii actually valid it came with like one tiny scratch on the side but that's nothing everything works perfectly sounds EVERYTHING,5
1513,"Came with no visible scratches and was working well. 84% Battery health when it arrived. The only thing that I would recommend would maybe include a lightning to audio jack connector, since that would come in the original box. But overall, I would say this was a good deal on a unlocked phone.",5
1514,Phones great only issue is when I talk to someone they sound low And muffled and on speaker they sound clear,3
1515,"Looked pretty and clean, worked on the cellular network just fine, but not at all to just barely on WiFi. Test your phones before reselling them.",1
1516,Phone constantly restarts itself. I waited too long to be able to return it.,1
1517,"This phone was suppose to be unlocked for T-Mobile, when we contacted T-Mobile to active that phone, they informed me that the IMEI is blocked on this phone.",1
1518,Amazing phone and the price could not be beat! Exactly as described and in amazing refurbished condition.  I will be using Kiss company again for future cellphone needs!,5
1519,"Is a really good phone, the only thing is the battery and for some reason the keyboard vibration doesn’t work. I don’t know yet if I will return the device because it says that this phone is almost in the 1000 cycle, so... (Also I did not receive the SIM card key, but that’s ok.)",4
1520,I received my iPhone 8 in gold and I highly recommended it battery capacity was 87 percent I called apple and got diagnostic testing done and everything works 100 percent iPhone is unlocked. Very happy with my purchase,5
1521,"Phone arrived cosmetically in mint condition, however the battery was almost useless. I had thought a life capacity of at least 80% like it says in the description would have been usable but it was at 79% upon powering on for the first time and would fully charge in about a half hour and be dead in about the same time too. Had to go out and pay for someone to replace it.",2
1522,Excellent,5
1523,It was great and very nice,5
1524,I cannot say enough positive things about this company or product. It came looking a brand new phone and with everything they promised. Only thing maybe they could toss in a set of headphones with the order but that’s a very minor thing. Other than that it is worth ordering from this company. I will definitely be back for more products.,5
1525,I'VE JUST HAD THIS IPHONE 8 FOR A FEW DAYS. SO FAR IT'S JUST LIKE HAVING A NEW PHONE. I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING ALL THE APPS AND DATA TRANSFERRED FROM MY 6SE BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM APPLE IT WENT QUICKLY. SO FAR SO GOOD.,4
1526,Me gusto,5
1527,Great camera and superb seller support. Would recommend this seller for buyers of refurbished camera.,5
1528,"Hybrid IT , Owner contacted me checking too why I didn’t like the product. This made me feel very good today. So any negative reviews I may have placed on the IPhone please disregard. It just wasn’t the size I was looking forward to. Thanks Mark for thinking about me enough to reach out for my feedback.",5
1529,"I like almost everything about this phone. The problems are the back camera is worse than an iPhone 6s maybe even as bad as the 5s or even worse than that and to add on to that, the back of my phone doesn’t even have an apple logo.. I am not happy with this purchase(DO NOT RECOMMEND)",5
1530,Worked perfectly. Looks like new.,5
1531,"Tres meses me duro,cuando quiere trabaja,no vuelvo a comprar teléfonos en Amazon me gustaría que me devolviera aunque sea el 50% de lo que pague",1
1532,Brought as CDC a gift for my wife. She loves it. No problems with fraudulent the phone. Works like new.,5
1533,"The phone works perfectly fine, I've it for over a year now. Haven't encountered any problems and worked well connecting to my T-Mobile SIM card. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.",5
1534,Came on time. Phone works great with no problems.,5
1535,Phone constantly drops calls. I wind up calling people back 3 or 4 times to complete a conversation. My wife calls I answer and it hangs up again 3 or 4 times.  Phone sucks!!!!,1
1536,"I was not able to connect it to my plan. It should be fully unlocked (and may be it is), but we were not able to activate it.Had to return it.",2
1537,"Received with a very large and deep scratch on the screen. Approximately 1/3 of the screen. The sellers description of no wear noticeable from arms length was not accurate for phone received. Forced to return phone and wait on refund and repurchase process.Rest of the phone looked good, but the scratch was too large to keep when paying for a “like new” phone.",2
1538,The phone is in amazing shape and appears brand new. Was refurbished but honestly couldn’t tell. Was exactly what it described in the listing and for a good price. Highly recommend this seller for refurbished iPhone,5
1539,"Packaging was good and came on time. You will need to buy a SIM card for the phone. I did notice that the phone seemed to be a little slow button wise. Typing in some things took a tad bit longer due to the slowness. Everything else seemed to work great, camera quality was good.",4
1540,Battery needed to be replaced when I received the phone. This was clearly stated under “settings”/“battery”/“battery health”. I’m disappointed that this wasn’t caught before the iPhone was released for sale.,3
1541,After ~7 months of use the left speaker stopped working,1
1542,Works as expected. I was charged $35 for the set-up/transfer at the local Verizon office.,5
1543,Very poorly packaged when I opened amazon box the phone was falling out of the box. There was no plastic film over the screen to take of as it says it’s “ renewed “ I expect the screen to come with that phone is completely dead as well hoping for good results when it turns on right now I am not impressed so far,2
1544,"Device very good, perfect condition",5
1545,Excellent customer service. Thank you for your help. Will be purchasing again soon.,5
1546,"The battery will last a day which is fine, other than that great phone!",5
1547,This phone is in excellent condition.  It coulld be a brand new iphone.  Once I charged the battery set up only took minutes since I had backed up my iphone 6S and just needed to restore that backup to this new iphone 8.  I have been using it since then and can't find any defects.  Very pleased with my purchase.,5
1548,"This phone was faulty. It would consistently say “cellular error”, turn on and off, and sign out of my iCloud account. Absolutely disastrous. I had to follow up and send MANY messages to the seller to finally get refunded nearly a month after sending back the phone. Do yourself a favor and do not bother.",1
1549,"I was really nervous to buy a used phone, but I am so glad I did. Everything on it works and looks like it's brand new. The battery life works 100%. I have not found anything wrong with this phone. I bought it from Verizon Used Phones, and I would definitely recommend.",5
1550,Good phone but it still had a small crack in the corner when it came.,4
1551,Arrived in great shape. Everything working perfectly. Very satisfied.,5
1552,Great item for a great price,5
1553,It consistantly drop out of internet. And I get spamed. I am not sure if the phone are been hack or not.Also I consistantly worry I was been lisened. I lost all my money just cause I want buy a cheap iPHONE?!This isn't not worth it.,1
1554,Phone turns off randomly and loses text messages in the process. SUPER disappointing for $500+.,1
1555,Love it! Like new condition and works perfect,5
1556,"iPhone is everything it claimed to.  It looks brand new, no scratches, cracks, or any kind of blemish.  Was able to connect with carrier in about 10 minutes. Battery charges to 100%.  Thumbs up for this purchase!!",5
1557,"It’s was like new, no damage to vanity & work very good!",5
1558,Phone arrived cosmetically in great condition. Started up immediately and was quick to set up. So far the battery life seems to be holding up and the phone is very fast and responsive. Very please with this phone especially for the price. Will update if I have issues in the near future,5
1559,Not sure,5
1560,This product is awesome. It was a gift that turned into a replacement phone for my son.,5
1561,this iPhone is totally scratched and the corner is smashedno more trust ....,1
1562,"Only downside to this phone is I just don’t like not having a headphone port. Other than that, fantastic",5
1563,Awesome,5
1564,This was well worth the money. Minor scratches on the screen and a camera issue is all I’ve had but it cost 200 less so I’d say it’s worth the money,5
1565,Llegó muy bien,5
1566,I love my new iPhone!!!!!!,5
1567,"Bought a refurb iPhone 8, works for about 10 minutes, then turned into a brick and won’t power on at all now",1
1568,"Warning ⚠️ the buyers must double think before they fall in a trap!!! It stopped on the 90th day and I can’t return it because the returning policy is with in 90 days. I have to trash 🗑 it.The screen gets darker, you can’t see nothing and there is no one can fix it!",1
1569,"It's a great phone for a good price! Good condition, everything is working. Came with a charger.",5
1570,nice phone,4
1571,It looks great I didn't get to use it yet cuz I need help setting it up I'm going to get help pretty soon I heard great things about it,5
1572,It came completely unscratched and the battery is great. It came with a working charger cable and a screen protector. It connected to my phone service as soon as the sim card was in. Great product. Exactly as advertised.,5
1573,"Phone showing problems within a month. Battery drops from 90 to 15 in a matter of 15-20 mins all of sudden sometimes. Screen goes blank and it takes more than an hour to get back to normal. I am travelling, so dont know I will be able to get it replaced through seller intime or not. Feeling bad...",1
1574,"The phone it self is in great condition. The only problem I had with it was, for some reason it was not compatible with my service Boost. Which was very strange. But I took it to sprint and was able to switch providers and didn’t have to pay an extra fees and turns out sprint had the phone plan i was offered at boost but for 10 dollars cheaper!",4
1575,I love this phone,5
1576,This is worth the money very clean and nice phone let’s see how long it will hold up for purchase last week Wednesday,5
1577,"got it for my mom, she loves it",5
1578,It came with what it said it would.. it works fine so far had some scratches on the screen but other than that decent shape,4
1579,Wow this is a solid deal phone is clean no cracks or noticeable scratches and the battery health is perfect!,5
1580,Had to return this as the ringer would not turn off which in turn meant the camera “snap” sound would not turn off.,2
1581,The phone is as good as new.  No issues whatsoever .  I would recommend this vendor for all your phone needs.,5
1582,"El equipo viene en caja de amazon renewed. El aparato vino muy bien protegido, sin ningun detalle de uso, como nuevo, anda todo, wifi, bluetooth, etc... viene con funda protectora y protector de pantalla, con cargador generico y cable...Mi esposa esta muy satisfecha!Gracias!",5
1583,"Extremely disappointed, I ordered an iPhone 8, the first time it arrived defective, the speakers were useless, I could barely hear anything during calls. I retuned it and ordered a new one hoping I would get a fully functioning phone this time but I received another defective phone. The second one would make a horrible machine sound every time I pressed the home button. I returned it as well.",1
1584,I was really nervous when getting this because I kept on seeing mixed reviews. But when I got it I was very pleased! It works perfectly fine and it’s an amazing upgrade from the 6s. I went to my phone carrier the same day to set up the SIM card and it all went smoothly!,5
1585,It was a gift,5
1586,Used one yet the Best iPhone I have ever had.,5
1587,"I bought this phone for my son.  It was in good shape when I received it, but was unable to be connected to our network even though it specifically said it was for that network.  Then I was charged a re-shelfing fee.",1
1588,Excellent phone. Got one that didn't work was able to send it back with no hassle and got another ordered. The phone is in great condition and is working well.  Definitely reccomend.,5
1589,Great phone. Exactly as described. Activated easily with current Verizon number.,5
1590,Never thought I’d have a iPhone again so in expensive too thanks for selling this awesome product no problem what so ever.,5
1591,I was worried at first after reading some negative reviews but I’m glad I took the risk. The product was amazing! It looks like new and worked like new I would make this purchase again I highly recommend it.,5
1592,Great,5
1593,The phone's IMEI was locked under a contract with some other provider. Such an inconvenience to wait for the delivery and then this - a huge waste of time.,1
1594,Great phone. Looked almost brand new. I trust Amazon's certified used phones now.,5
1595,Good,5
1596,"I received the phone with a poorly replaced screen, the glass is cheaper than what is used on new phones, and is peeling away from the adhesive. The glass is so cheap it started chipping without hardly any use (I also have a lifeproof case on the phone)",2
1597,My daughter loves it,5
1598,The product was as good as new without any scratches or marks. The phone data was clean and I was able to login to the carrier using my SIM card. Prompt delivery was made with proper boxes and product numbers.,5
1599,"So far, so good.  No issues this far with the phone",4
1600,The battery is way below 80% the screen looks burnt on the sides. There is a small spot in the lower left side of the screen underneath the glass. Repaired it myself and it looks like it’s never been opened.,2
1601,"Battery was 100%. Internals haven’t wigged out on me just yet (Day two). Absolutely no issues cosmetically. Need I say more?? Based on previous reviews, it seems Amazon renewed is really a hit or miss. Risk comes with worry. And you’ll be worried no matter how ya slice it. But, with a 90 day guarantee, I’d say shoot ya shot! Might just be as surprised as I was. Cheers!",5
1602,Individual iPhone!,5
1603,Horrible experience!!! This phone was not unlocked and a complete waste of time!! Forget it!! Don't waste your time...,1
1604,"The phone came with all it's parts and had no cosmetic damage, but the fingerprint scanner died within 5 days with no major drops or damage.It's too much of a headache to send it back since i bought it as a gift for a friend in a foriegn country.",2
1605,After 3 months the phone is now not operable it says the phone was stolen,5
1606,"El iPhone esta en Excelente condiciones (Mejor de lo que esperaba), funciona perfectamente en Chile y lo mejor es que su batería esta al 100%.",5
1607,The item works fine but we discovered an annoying scratch right in the middle of the screen and have asked for a replacement.  We are awaiting return authorization.  Authorization has been received and iphone returned.  Amazon says they will credit my account.  you can't ask for much more than that.,5
1608,We have had it for baout a month and a half now. It occassionally is a little slow/glitchy but other then that its nice. It only reads our finger prints a quarter of the time. At points the phone stops working and it gets frustrating.,4
1609,Will not work when adding sims card. Went to Verizon store and they said it broken. Just sent back and will let everyone know how it goes. Suppose to send another one.Still waiting after a week for them to send another phone. Been calling everyday and the lady says they sent it out. I have no tracking number or anything.Don’t recommend them.,2
1610,Phone works like new and I’ve had no problems with it over the month I’ve had it. There are no visible scratches or cracks. It came with a charger but no head phones which was disappointing because there’s only a lightning port for the headphones. It did also come with a SIM card tool so I didn’t have to go to Verizon. Very pleased overall,5
1611,"Like new condition, great purchase!",5
1612,I would never have purchased this phone If I'd known you could not disable the camera noise. WHAT A SUPER DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! I will more than likely go back to my Iphone 6.,1
1613,The battery was significantly degraded my phone won’t even charge now don’t buy from this seller,1
1614,Works great! But needs to be in better packing.,5
1615,Great deal and superb service. The phone came in excellent condition and still works very well.It came with 2nd party charging cable and charger. I love my IPhone 8 !,5
1616,"Was not sure what I'd get ordering a ""Renewed"" phone.  I am more than delighted.  In outstanding condition - flawless.  Thank you!",5
1617,Nothing I don’t like it is just like brand new. Love it,5
1618,"Ordered this phone d/t the battery on my old phone wasn’t working well... this phone was even WORSE! Couldn’t hold a charge for a few hours!!! Uuuggghhh, bitterly disappointed!",1
1619,Had no problem switching my sim card to this one. Works great,5
1620,"This was a gift and an upgrade from an iPhone 6. I don’t want to talk about the iPhone tech— go to a apple for that. I want to talk about the fact that it’s a refurbished iPhone for a ridiculous price that had me worried because it seemed toooo cheap. Well, it worked out without any issues. I can vouch for it being unlocked because it’s currently being used in Tokyo on a non-American carrier.",5
1621,"Super contenta con la compra. El teléfono llego rápido. LO TRAJE A PANAMÁEstado físico: Impecable, ningún rasguño.Bateria: 90% (lo que promete)entrega: rápido, vino super protegido. Estoy super feliz hasta el momento todo bien",5
1622,"fiscamente aceptable como en las descripciones estipula pero no le funcionan las bocinas, no recomiendo la compra !",1
1623,I normally do not write reviews. I received this phone yesterday and was returning it right away. I set it up but the calls are not coming in.. really dissapointed.,1
1624,I don’t usually buy something as a ‘second’ but was very impressed.,5
1625,The product said excellent condition. But the actual phone is so damaged.,2
1626,Works like new,5
1627,Horrible battery life,1
1628,much better than the 'new' one i was ripped off for from charter/spectrum and didn't cost me 1/5 as much.  possibly the best cell phone i have ever had.  i will definitely purchase from this company again when i upgrade.,5
1629,Excellent buy. Can’t believe that it’s not brand new. Everything was new about it. I’ve had it for 5 months now and still excellent,5
1630,"Despite the bad reviews, I purchased this item and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The phone arrived in good condition and took just a few moments to set up.",5
1631,Works great. No visual scratches!,5
1632,The product is flawedTook it overseas as BDay presentNever could be startedTook it to Apple store in Spain diagnosed as flawed motherboardSeller would neither return or repairBY ALL MEANS AVOID THIS CHEATER,1
1633,The phone most likely was originally sold in another country. Some functions follow privacy regulations set in other countries but not in the US. Aside from this being a little annoying the phone works great.,4
1634,"I've bought several 'renewed' phones over the years and this was the first that was visibly damaged with a scratched screen - one scratch about 1.5cm long.  The battery is showing as able to charge to 95% of its original capacity, which is prety good for an older phone, but again not as good as I've had in the past.  Delivery and functionality are all great.",3
1635,"Phone in good shape. Battery at 87% health which isn’t great but it’s workable. Slight smudge in the screen pixels (oval shape, about 2“ x 3/4”, but very faint and hard to notice). Was worried the smudge would grow darker with time but so far so good. If this phone maintains its current performance I’ll be very satisfied with my purchase. Will update if there are issues.",4
1636,"This is a scam, this phone is not fully unlocked. I went to my local Sprint store and they said there is no way for this phone to be activated. Even though it is being advertised that this phone is fully unlocked and I picked the fully unlocked option. Highly disappointed, I am trying to return it. Don't waste your money or time.",1
1637,if your looking for a iphone cheap these are the guys to buy it from 100 percent like and will buy fro them again like wtf 178 for an iphone you would be stupid not to buy. and this is a real buyers comment btw add me on playstation @ blxntgreen for more evidence,5
1638,"Got this phone as a bring your own to tracfone.  The apparence was new, it is working fine. Setup was easy as we just put my six next to my 8, it even updated an app.  The screen clarity is better than my Iphone six.  I am 64, so if I can work it easy it is good.",5
1639,"It has been a great value for the money. The battery has been great, and that was an issue with the last refurbished phone we got. Completely satisfied with this phone!",5
1640,I know this is a refurbished product so there's just so much one can really complain about it but the sounds quality on the phone I got was pretty bad. It seem like the speaker is cracking all the time.,3
1641,Phone went into black screen of death after 2 weeks.,2
1642,our first smart phones reasonably priced delivery was quick phones are working well,5
1643,"the phone functions and looks great. The only thing is the camera shutter sound is always on so I can’t take selfies or Snapchat  because everyone around me will hear it, and the sound is not quiet by any means.",3
1644,"It was an iPhone 8 and worked, did not come in the original packaging which was warned, and the batter capacity was 85% which they also said would happen.",5
1645,This phone is blacklist plus the battery dies fast . It’s not worth to buy . The wait was to long took 4 days to come in and to connect my cellular service I have to wait for them to take off the black I got to wait longer to for the refund .,1
1646,I was a bit skeptical on buying this phone since most of the review were bad but to my surprise it arrived in excellent condition and came with a screen protector as well. I’m honestly satisfied with this purchase.,4
1647,"This renewed phone was locked by the company that appears to have previously owned and issues it to an employee, Medline Industries Inc. and without a company login it could not be reset. The seller ignored requests for assistance.",1
1648,Great phone! The only issue I had was that The phone Was incompatible to Boostmobile which I was tired of this company anyhow and Was ready to switch to another carrier. Works great with t mobile though,5
1649,Phone works fine and is in pretty good condition. I was unaware however that I was buying a Japanese model phone (not mentioned anywhere) and now am stuck with a loud and annoying shutter sound whenever I try to take a picture and there is nothing that I can do about it.,3
1650,👍,4
1651,Very happy with how easy my purchase was. Great price for a very well functioning refurbished phone. Shipped quickly had no damage and everything on the phone works perfectly. Thank you!!,5
1652,Works like new,5
1653,Phone looked great if only it was actually fully unlocked. Don't do it. And they keep 20% even if you return it the next day.,1
1654,honestly taught the phone was good but it keeps rebooting by it self and im really pissed,1
1655,"Besides it not being in original packaging, Got here in one day and great condition from what I can see.",5
1656,Compre un iPhone 8 re-manufacturado y revisado. Se supone que ha sido revisado y el parlante frontal llego defectuoso. Se escucha ronco y no se entiende bien lo que dice la otra persona. Cuando lo recibí la habian bajado el volumen para que no se notara el daño en un claro gesto de deshonestidad. Sabían que el parlante estaba malo y no lo arreglaron.,3
1657,This phone looks and operates as good as new.,5
1658,"The phones actually came 4 days sooner than they were supposed to be delivered and both were in perfect condition. The fingerprint scanner worked, battery has a full charge, and face recognition worked just fine. Well worth the money we spent!!",5
1659,I have been an Android user since cell phones... Well a REALLY long time. My daughter convinced me to switch and I am so glad she did. This phone is amazing!,5
1660,It’s an apple product!,5
1661,My phone arrived before expected.  It works great. It already had a screen protector.  I've had it a couple of weeks and I haven't had any problems with it at all.  Definitely happy with my purchase.,5
1662,"It works really good, fast delivery.",5
1663,"Was a bit hesitant to purchase this phone on here, But have to say it is in Excellent Condition, works perfect, came in on time and they even added a charger free ! I Recommend this company 100% !",5
1664,I bought about 2 years ago & i still have it in case! Thank u Amazon for having reliable product.,5
1665,The phone works fine and batter life is good. Hope it stays that way for a couple of years until 5G gets sorted with Apple,5
1666,I could not be happier with it! Absolutely perfect condition. Thank you!,5
1667,"Absolutely does NOT work with sprint service. I ordered the fully unlocked version that specified compatible with all service providers, including sprint. Sprint told me that the phone was not compatible with their services. Thankfully I was able to return the phone, but still very inconvenient.",1
1668,"Works well, even if it's reconditioned.",5
1669,My new (refurbished) iPhone works great. I’m extremely pleased with the size. This phone has remarkable features and memory. Prior to purchasing this phone I was using an iPhone SE.,5
1670,Screen is almost a micro screen compared to my note 8 and without a way to expand memory I can see why I stay away from iphones,4
1671,First one went haywire.  Sent it backWe haven't had the second long enough to make a clear call.,3
1672,Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. Works perfect and has no issues! Thank you!!!!,5
1673,"I dislike that it is advertised as unlocked, when in fact it was not. They did accept my return and apologized.",1
1674,"Works with AT&T wifi-calling, battery life is better than my previous phone, takes great photos, it definitely has everything you could need, even for 2021.",5
1675,It worked good for 2 months then completely blacked out for no reason. Still have yet to receive refund!,1
1676,"GREAT, LIKE NEW, ON time, PERFECT",5
1677,Couldn't even activate the phone. Now I gotta send it back... Uggggg,1
1678,"it works as if a brand new one, came right away, aproximately 3 daysafter iorder. great.",5
1679,I got it my grandson and he loves it the phone works perfectly fine,5
1680,"The phone was in near new condition, battery life is acceptable and I received my order a day early.No activation problems or carrier lock!!!!!!!As Advertised!I would recommend this seller.",5
1681,Phone is indistinguishable from a new phone. Battery capacity at 88 percent versus a promised minimum of 80 percent.  Very happy with purchase!,5
1682,"This phone is in perfect condition and fully functional! Very satisfied with my purchase.. The reviews are either hit or miss, so I took a gamble but was prepared and committed to returning repeatedly if necessary, glad I got a good deal on the first try..",5
1683,I get that the phone is “renewed” but the speakers are busted. Sound quality is horrible and the bottom speakers don’t work.Everything else is working fine.,3

1707,"Seller guaranteed that the phone would ship with 80% battery capacity minimum. No such  luck here. While iOS reports that my phone’s battery capacity is at 50% peak, check out the charge history - it dropped from 100% to 0% within five minutes of unplugging it. So disappointing.",1
1708,Acts like a new phone! Very user friendly! Love the size & happy with battery life. 🙂,5

1720,Phone works but has a bunch of scratches across the screen.,1
1721,The phone was not unlocked. It actually has a warning when you try and set it up. Pretty much stating the phone cant and won’t be able to be set up threw any service. So pretty much it’s just a wifi phone. Do not buy it’s a big scam.,1

1723,The phone was not able to activate after trying two SIM cards. had to return it.,1

1749,"It was in great condition, a few minor scratches in the chassis and screen. battery health was at 89% which is still good. The speakers were kind of dirty and there was some dust/lint particles by the camera which could be cleaned before sending.",5
1750,"came early, works great can't even tell it's referbished",5
1751,"The phone came sim locked even though it states FULLY UNLOCKED, I have no idea what carrier it is locked to because its a second hand phone. I contacted the seller about this issue, they have not answered.  There are ways around this but it's a pain.",1
1752,Great price and like new. So far so good,5

1758,"Looks like new. No issues with how it works, battery life, or the looks of the item. Everything was as described.",5
1759,This phones speaker does not work! Any incoming or outgoing calls you can’t hear anything but a bunch of scratchy noises. Can’t hear the person on either side of the phone. Do not buy any phones from this company 🤬,1
1760,"This is safer than buying off of Facebook market place, Craigslist, Offer Up and even LetGo. You don’t have to worry about the phone not working or a bad imei number or even damage to the device. Amazon offer you that extra security. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.",5

1765,This came and looked completely new. No scratches or issues. Works great.. owned for 4mo now.,5
1766,I am returning this product because it does not support MetroPCS and I assume that an unlocked phone means just that. wasting our time trying to unlock a phone that does not even support our current network is not fun. Please be more specific about what networks your phone support. Kudos for delivering a product one week early.,2
1767,When I received the Amazon Refurbished I phone the phone would not work unless it was plugged into the charger. How can you certify that you RENEWED a cell phone and have a battery in that condition? I ended up buying a new iphone from verizon that cost $100 more and works great.,1
1768,This Phone was just like it said it was great iphone,5
1769,"Unlike the description on website, it's not like new.I understand a bit as it's a renewed product but ,even so, I felt not satisfied bcz it's too much damaged.However, in the functional perspective and battery quality, it's good to use.If I didnt consider the functional quality as the highest priority, I would have returned it already.",3
1770,Has worked perfectly for the six months we’ve had it,5
1771,Selling 6’s for 8’s,1
1772,Electronic deals was very helpful and patient with me. I had to return two phones (both with audio issues) but this third one has worked wonderfully. I gave them four stars because I had to return multiple times but otherwise very good.,4
1773,"The phone came with 90 day warranty, and it failed at about 120 days. I contacted the seller, but, he was not willing to give a partial credit on returning the phone for another.",2
1774,"It is really worth it. I ordered a renewed iPhone 8 64gb and luckily and 100% battery capacity. And the phone is defect less, it looks brand new. It also came with a screen protector and a sim ejector tool. I am extremely satisfied. It is definitely worth spending your money.",5

The charger cable was not working very well from the first week I received the cell phone, I had to re-plug in for several times no matter connected it to my laptop or the socket.

1788,"I’ve had this phone for about a month and so far it has worked perfectly fine. When I got it, i right away checked it’s imei to be sure it wasn’t blacklisted or something. I didn’t want to put my info or SIM card right away, but imei is clean, so it’s all good! It wasn’t damaged at all. It looks new! Battery lasts a long time. It was a good deal if I say so.",5

1812,"So I ordered the iPhone in gold,64 gb, fully unlocked. But what had came was the iPhone in black but totally unlocked, I made sure I ordered the gold one.

1814,I upgraded my phone and it’s very little difference but I still appreciate it,5
1815,Works good without any issues.,5
1816,The phone itself works fine but not once has my battery ever died on 1%. In fact it hasn’t gotten to 1% once since I’ve bought it. So without that annoying detail it’s fine.,3
1817,Perfect..  great condition even though it is refurbished,5

1821,The phone does not work. It freezes all the time despite software update. Sometimes I am unable to even re-start the phone. It's like the buttons don't even work. I never had such issues with an Iphone! It is useless and I only had it for a few months.,1
1822,Love it looked brand new came early,5

1830,"We got this phone for our babysitter because she goes above and beyond for our family. It was truly worth the price and in 99.9% perfect condition. It had two very tiny scratches on the screen, but almost didn't see them. It works great and so far no issues. It's a pretty phone and she absolutely loves it.",5
1831,"Phone was cute but arrived with a fine crack in the screen despite being well packaged.  Trademore was slow to get back with me but it looks as if they are going to take care of it now.  Not thrilled but I mistakes happen and as long as they get it all taken care of, we'll consider using them again.",3

1842,Very good price and works fine. Had minor scratches but it was already mentioned clearly in the description. Satisfied with the purchase.,5
1843,I switch from an android to a iPhone. I know There a big difference in the two. Either I bought a phone where the volume doesn’t work or there a secret to fixing it so the other person on the phone doesn’t sound like their in a tunnel.,2
1844,Great product for an even greater price.,5
1845,I bought this so my middle school child could have an affordable iPhone.,5

Y no se a quien reclamar.",1
1866,Phone was a Christmas present and it wouldn't charge or turn on at all. Very disappointed.,1

1869,"I got my product phone would turn off and just keep turning on and off over and over , and don’t get me started on how I put my SIM card in and I didn’t have any service , cause it kept going up and down disconnecting and reconnecting. Do not recommend buying this !",1

1888,"Was kind of Spectacle about buying a Renewed iPhone 8. When receiving it, it came in a generic box. iPhone looks like new and it will be a great Frist phone for my son. Would of liked if it came  with an actual apple charger and brick instead of a bootleg one.",5
1889,"Actually was better than expected, as it’s is renewed product, I was hoping to see some scratch or something, but it loooks brand new",5
1890,Excellent condition !! Everything works perfectly,5
1891,Purchased phone for my son for christmas when he opened it the phone was missing the sim card trey VERY DISAPPOINTED,3
1892,"While the phone was in excellent condition, when I tried to add a SIM card for cell service I was told the phone had an outstanding balance or was still under contract with another carrier. Working through the return process now.",1
1893,Took it to Tmobile and was told I couldn’t use it. Had to return it.,1
1894,"Phone works great overall save for one crucial feature: phone calls. When I attempt to call someone, I can hear them but they cannot hear me. I’ve tested all three microphones and they all work well, but for whatever reason calls still don’t work.",2
1895,It was in mint condition and works perfect. It came with a box and charger.,5
1896,The iphone it's in perfect condition.I make a test series and it's like a new iPhone 8.Baterry life 100%.Renewed premium it's the bests phones in Amazon.I am very satisfied with this phone.,5
1897,It’s had no scratches Touch ID works great best renewed phone I bought,5
1898,"This product did not work with my provider.  When I returned it, all I got was an email stating that I sent them a can of tuna and two pieces of black fabric.  Do not use this seller.  You will be out your money with no chance to get it back.",1
1899,She seems to like it fine.,5
1900,I keep reminding myself that it is a used item. Battery life not great but better than my 5 year old 5c. Fingerprint is frustrating. I’ve redone it a few times and still won’t work. But it does the job for me and isn’t a bad value for the money.,3
1901,"The phone worked fine in the US with our existing carrier and was easy to set up - however, it must have been an Asian model.  The camera sound could not be turned off.  We had to return it.  Seller gave us a refund without issue.",3
1902,I bought it for trading it in with AT&T to get the discount they were offering. And it was perfect. It came nicely packaged and with the charger too.,5
1903,Had an issue with battery not holding charge. Seller was prompt and courteous about solving the issue. Daughter loves the iPhone!,4
1904,"LOOKS GOOD, WORKS GOOD.",5
1905,So far it’s a great phone! Battery life isn’t the greatest but otherwise a great buy!,4
1906,Just like picture and runs as if brand new. Would never guess it wasn’t.. love it!! Now even a year later,5
1907,"Phone arrived and it was everything I'd expect from an iPhone 8, with one critical exception: it was MQ862J/A. The main difference this makes on a day to day basis for anyone buying this is that the camera sound is hardwired on due to Japanese law. So, caveat emptor, you may be stuck with the annoying camera sound.",3
1908,"Can barely hear on this phone, even when on speaker, mobile network will not connect at all, can only use wifi, and it lags when connected to wifi. Horrible, I do not recommend.",1
1909,We loved  the price/quality-,5
1910,thank you,5
1911,"La bateria estaba en 89%, no es malo pero pense que podria estar mejor. Todo funciona perfecto. La caja viene con cargador y adaptador, SIN auriculares. Funciona perfecto. Lo recomiendo",4
1912,"The display is not as vibrant and colorfull as my previous iphone. While the touch screen is functioning properly,something is not right with the screen colors. I suspect the screen was replaced with some cheap knock off and not an apple genuine part. I should had spent $200 more and got a brand new one from apple. I regret this purchase!",2
1913,Excelente,5
1914,Great price and arrived quickly,5
1915,I haven't been able to use it yet but the phone itself seems to be very nice. However it would have been nice to have some directions with at least the basic instructions with it.  I will give you a review as soon as I'm able to use it.,5
1916,Was not as described was supposed to be cdma unlocked and they sent a gsm,1
1917,I was pleased on the prompt service an arrival of my iPhone . It works great and is in great condition. I definitely will be purchasing again from this company .,5

1930,It's a good for a refurbished phone. Battery capacity is 84% which is expected. A few tiny scratches. Screen is fine. Will give an updated phone after a month of use.,4
1931,"The phone came I good condition but whe I receive calls, I can hardly hear. It’s not the volume either. I don’t want the hassle of sending it back so I just ordered ear buds. Never will I purchase another used phone. You get what you pay for...sometimes",2

1938,"Excellent condition, battery life is great, and it was SUPER easy to transfer everything. And I have straight talk",5
1939,iPhone call volume so low that it renders the whole phone useless. Be cautious buying a phone from here it’s a hit or miss deal whether or not it will work.,1
1940,I am so disappointed about the iphone. The seller described it was a good condition but the back camera shakes and the speaker on left side does not work and even the right side is very bad speaker. Sound is not clear and damaged. I want to send back the iphone but it looks not easy to do that. How can I fix this trouble.,1

2107,Trying to make calls on speaker phone has audio issues.,3
2108,So far I really like the phone. So I’m definitely giving 5 stars.,5
2109,Had to return product it was damaged waiting on refund. It was my grandson’s Christmas now I am having to get something else for him. Not happy at all. The screen has deep scratches and the product was  listed as in new condition,1
2110,Screen was replaced with a non sapphire screen,2
2111,Just got it so far it's going pretty well it basically came brand new on how it looks with a generic apple charger so far extremely happy!!I recomend,5

2121,The phone came in great condition and well packed. The only disappointment I was that the over all battery quality was 85% total. Having a iPhone HR for over a year with the battery quality being 96% this was a letdown. Definitely we going to return this phone.,2

2123,This iPhone cams and worked properly for about 1 month then I took it to be repaired and found out that it had SEVERAL internal parts missing!! DO NOT BUT FROM THIS SELLER!! I sent it back for a refund and after 3weeks I still haven’t received my refund!!,1
2124,I’ve had my refurbished iPhone 8 for a little over a month and so far so good. Very satisfied and the cost was just right. I would order a refurbished phone in the future when needed. It was delivered in ample time!,4

2129,This is the second device I purchased AMAZON RENEWED and it looks and functions like brand new. @ for 2 with Amazon. I fully recommend.,5
2130,The camera was very blurry and was not good and on the back you can tell that it is fake but other than that it works well and has a little bit of mem6,5

2133,GREAT condition. I would buy again,5
2134,The phone came in excellent condition and working as expected.,5

2136,"I’m more than happy with the product I received, especially since it’s my first apple product. I’ve had a positive experience overall and will definitely consider future products by the company. Thx : )",5
2137,Camera is intermittent. Not reliable. Wish I never bought it.,2
2138,"Do not buy!!! I bought this product and it came broken every time I move the phone, touch the home button or type it makes this annoying, loud, screeching noise. Had to go to apple and have it fixed directly by them.",1

2146,"The delivery was prompt as estimated, and the phone overall is good.",4
2147,"Phone I received was scratched from the bottom surface and after a month of use abruptly died on me, after several diagnostics at the apple store, we found it had nothing to do with the battery but device was having a circuit board issue.",1
2148,"Just like new, works perfect. Great battery life, and all functions work great",5
2149,I didn’t want to make a review until my daughter actually fully used it  very good product the batter does go down fast but that because she stays on it 24/7,5

2164,Just like new! Glad I saved so much money 😊Still paying off the new one I bought through AT&T.,5
2165,"Not ‘almost new’ the SIM card holder has a big break, the screen is scratched HORRIBLY all over!!! Definitely a well used phone 😡",2

2175,I bought this for my dad to upgrade him from his old phone. Took long (understandable tho). The phone looked perfect so we went to his carrier to try to activate it. It came up as blacklisted. DEFINITELY READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS (update: I got a replacement phone. It worked fine),2

2189,Great phone for the price! It may be refurbished but it’s like new!,5

2349,Love this phone came way early and was a little confused because it came in fed ex and not ups but besides that’s great phone had 1 scratch but doesn’t effect the phone,5
2350,The phone was in great condition however it was not unlocked for T-mobile even though it was advertised that it would be. We called Amazon and they said the seller would contact us in 48 hrs. We received no call from the seller.,1
2351,loved the product!,5
2352,"The phone has issues, but the service on this phone from my vendor was incredible and I was shocked.  Not sure if they get credit in this review but they are legit!",5
2353,very happy,5
2354,Was skeptical at first but once I received it I’m very pleased. Exactly as advertised. Will be buying all my phones from this company.,5
2355,This is a great phone!,5
2356,My son is happy with this phone.,4
2357,Battery,1
2358,"Upon turning on this phone•Started charging it because I couldn't turn it on, and as soon as it came on 2 minutes later it was at 35%...Red flag•Set everything up, once my apps started downloading the phone got pretty hot{Will update this as life goes on}",3
2359,"Good deal, but the charger was not good",4
2360,"Upgraded from a 6s to the 8.  Phone was in better condition than I expected.  Noticeably faster than the 6s.  Transferring pics, messages, apps, etc from old 6s to the 8 was very easy.  Good overall experience.",5
2361,Seems to work alright but the camera won’t work,3
2362,Since the phone didn’t charge or even turn on I’d rate this seller as fraudulent. I’m sending the phone back and likely purchasing a phone from a source other than Amazon.,1
2363,Got this a gift for a closer friend; and he loves it. Works perfectly,5
2364,Everything worked perfect so far!,5
2365,10/10 would recommend this product. It took less then a week to arrive and when it did it looked brand new in mint condition with a screen protector on. The fingerprint reader works perfectly and it came a brand new charging cord and charging box which both work perfectly. Over all this product is definitely worth the price.,5
2366,Conforme,5
2367,Have had the phone for about a month with no problems. Works as advertised and looked new. They also put a screen protector on it before shipping. That was a nice surprise,5
2368,"The charger is a random black cube that isn’t fit the phone, also it didn’t even come with the headphones!",3
2369,This 8 I Phone has two issues1. The sim card will not open to add card. it is jammed2. The battery will not hold a charge,1
2370,Good price,5
2371,I’m pleased with phone and how good it works.battery life is ok.  I do have one spot in the bottom left corner that does not respond well to touch.,4
2372,Came in quickly and in perfect condition! Cheap price and hasn't given me any issues so far.,4
2373,The phone didn’t work. Had to send it back for refund.,1
2374,It was great for the price.,5
2375,"I purchased 2 renewed iPhone 8, both came in great shape with good battery life.",5
2376,Works greatA*****,5
2377,"Phone just stopped working.  Took it to Geek Squad.  They checked it out to make sure there was no water damage, which there was not, and they couldn't repair it.",1
2378,"Disappointed with this purchase, said fully unlocked but it was not!",1
2379,For it being an 8 it was in perfect condition and plenty of storage.,5
2380,"El envío fue rápido, el celular llego en perfecto estado, sin ningún detalle y con bateria al 91%Definitivamente volvería a comprar de este proveedor.",5
2381,This phone is like brand new. Really surprised that it already came with a glass screen protector. Really satisfied with my new phone!,5
2382,"I have a week of using it and there’re no complains! I do recommend it if you want to save some money and have a good phone!Only complain is that 1 week after I receive it, the price dropped a lot 😖",5
2383,👍,5
2384,"If I ddidn't know better I would have thought it was brand new, not renewed. No scratches or dents. Bought for Grandsons birthday and he is very excited to own it. Excellent job",5
2385,So far Ihavehad my phone2 months and all works well,5
2386,Everything was exactly as I expected. No issues so far. No problem swapping it.,5
2387,"Good looking, clean and complete phone. Everything works and battery life is 100%Got here a day after my daughter's birthday (my fault -should have ordered sooner) but still 4 days earlier than expected delivery! Good phone.",5
2388,Awesome,5
2389,"I was hesitant to purchase a phone before seeing it, but I’m very pleased. The phone appears in great condition and works perfectly. The battery life isn’t perfect but that’s to be expected with a previously used phone. Overall great purchase.",5
2390,Excellent purchase for my 10year old daughter. I didn’t get a pager until I was 15 years old. Things have def changed,4
2391,Excellent condition,5
2392,"I can confirm that at first I was skeptical about buying a phone from Amazon but I got it with minimal scratches and a great battery life of 93%, everything was as advertised",5
2393,longer battery life. wonderful picture quality.,5
2394,Came and was very slow.,3
2395,Basically got a new IPhone 8 at 250$ less. Battery life was at 96% capacity and not a single mark on the phone even though it was listed at A- quality. Definitely worth it.,5
2396,The charger socket doesn't work! only it works with the fake charger port which comes with the package.,3
2397,"Mint phone, inserted my sim card and it booted right up",5
2398,It came as expected charger broke in a couple days and it didn’t have headphones but I expected that the actual phone is great and looks brand new battery a little worn but not horrible highly recommended,5
2399,"This is the 5th refurbished phone I have purchased from amazon.com and I am thrilled once again with the purchase. Arrived quickly, works beautifully, great seller.",5
2400,"I bought this phone for my mom and it stopped working good in 1 month! First the camera turned black, then the battery doesn’t fully charge, and now the phone keeps freezing, don’t waste your money on this",1
2401,It works great and was way cheaper to buy here than from apply or through my phone carrier. Came with a charger cable and box. Also came with metal pick thing to help get the SIM card out,3
2402,This is the second phone. First one arrived to us not functioning properly. They sent out a another phone and have had it for 7 months and now has a hardware issue were you can’t connect to WiFi or Bluetooth. Just buy it new.,1
2403,I rarely write reviews but I had to for this one. I got it as a birthday gift and it is amazing. No problem at all no scratches basically new besides packaging. Came quick and is so much more affordable compare to the price on Apple. Would buy again. Go for it if your not sure,5
2404,"This was a B-day gift for my daughter so IDK, but I see that she can't even...and yea.... Just get it and don't ask...",5
2405,Buenas,4
2406,Battery life sucks,3
2407,Return,3
2408,I think it is amazing quality and great really recommend  it,5
2409,Reasonable or affordable price and like new condition.,5
2410,I received a phone in excellent conditions.,5
2411,hey guys i just want to say thank your the phone my boyfriend loved it but the small issue is that i thought i had bought the 8plus instead of the regular 8 because i had typed it in . anyhow the phone is working great the charger works well it charges really fast and it’s just amazing.,5
2412,Great,5
2413,"The phone came with many scratches on the back and the sides and not to mention that the battery life was at 76, didn’t even come with a cord just the box",2
2414,"Does not work with the Sprint network. Packaging, accessories and the phone looked great! I was really disappointed that Sprint could not activate it. Seller refunded quickly.",3
2415,Luce casi nuevo,5
2416,I paid for for an iphone 8 but got the SE. I am definitely returning this because I want what I paid for. This is deception,1
2417,"My son loves his phone, only issue is that when it gets hot it will shut down and he has to wait for it to cool down.",5
2418,Tried to set the phone up with sprint but they said the phone was either locked to another carrier (it seems to be unlocked) or was still registered under another account.,1
2419,The iPhone 8 works great. Great battery life and you can charge it without having to plug it in.,5
2420,Great,5
2421,Only issue I had is the charging cable doesn't work. Had to purchase another just to fully charge my phone.,5
2422,Literally the only reason I was thinking about returning is because I would buy the 8 plus from the same buyer. There was a tiny scratch on the top left but my case covers it. I love this phone so much!!! Thank you!!!,5
2423,I bought it for my dad as a gift. It was just as pictured. Works great my dad likes it.,5
2424,"The one I received overheats, and loses signal easily when it heats up. Other than that it works fine. Just annoying I have to stick it in the freezer for a minute sometimes, and FaceTiming really taxes it.",2
2425,Works well and it came in good shape,5
2426,Good phone but doesn't hold a charge.,5
2427,It looks like new and seems to be working just fine.,5
2428,I got that phone in may just had to change the screen and pay 65$ because it’s not working I wish I didn’t buy it,1
2429,iPhone was a Verizon refurbished phone. Worried at first it would not be compatible with Consumer Cellular (works off AT&T) but I've had no issues and the phone was in mint condition.  Came with charging cord and plug plus tool to access SIM card.,5
2430,"Phone shuts off randomly. It’s annoyong when it’s an important call you’re on. I only had it for 3 days,.. but it’s refurbished so you risk it.",2
2431,Good product,5
2432,"The phone was in mint condition, 100% battery life, and a glass screen protector came installed on it. Really have nothing bad to say. Item came better than expected",5
2433,I really liked the phone until I realized when you take pictures the shutter sound doesn't go away even when you silence your phone. I found out that phones made in China have this feature since it's illegal to silence phones while taking pictures there..was completely unaware this would happen and I'm disappointed.,3
2434,The fingerprint option and face recognition option was great on this IPhone. No issues with battery,4
2435,Camera shakes from first time used. Would like replacement or repair.,3
2436,Love it! Replaced my old 7 plus and I couldn’t be happier.,5
2437,This product looked brand new! Arrived timely. Excellent customer service. I will always look for the ”Kanga” Supply Company when ordering electronics.,5
2438,Happy customer,5
2439,I bought this phone for as a trade in for an AT&T trade-in offer.  The phone looked brand new and worked fine for the short time I had it before it was traded in.,5
2440,The screen of this phone was significantly scratched out of the box despite being advertised as “renewed by Amazon”. I do not recommend buying this item on Amazon.,2
2441,"This phone is very slow, the ringer doesn't work, battery is terrible. I don't recommend. I don't feel that the price is accurate with how well the phone works. I rather use an android this is terrible, and that's bad for me because I hate androids.",1
2442,"I ordered this phone to get a heavy discount off of the new iPhone 11 I’m trying to buy. Apple would not accept it due to a small nick in the upper corner of the screen, now I need to return this and order a new one to get my discount",3
2443,Phone was liked very much for the short time it worked then after returning phone and many phone calls and emails and a negative review was able to get refund issued.,3
2444,Don’t waste your time.The phone I received was never paid off by original owner and as such is permanently locked. The seller clearly states the phone to Unlocked and that could not be further from the truth. Fraudulent selling practices!,1
2445,"The device seems like newAll options and software is working wellBut there is one of two speakers is not working, I think this is a very important info which shouldn’t be hidden for the customerIf i knew that the speaker is not workingI wouldn't buy the deviceMaher yacoub",3
2446,great product,5
2447,Love that it works just like a brand new IPhone!  Thank you so much.😊,5
2448,My grandaughter loves her new phone!,5
2449,Battery live is perfect,5
2450,Everything is like new except for the battery health which is 80% as described.,5
2451,Thanks got it on time and everything. And it’s in great shape,5
2452,"product is just as described -no frills about it. It is an iphone 8, batter is as described, the phone works and looks great.",5
2453,The advertise product says the battery health would be over 80% but when I received the device it has a battery health of 77%,3
2454,Looks super nice. No visible damage. Everything works well.,5
2455,"Ordered this phone as a Christmas gift. It showed up on time, everything worked on the phone, but the battery life was diminished. Having a hard time contacting seller to be replaced.",2
2456,Loke new works well,5
2457,"Phone came 3 days earlier then expected. Surprisingly, had literally no sign of wear (just a tiny scratch that was barely visible on the side). The phone has been working great for me so far (5 days) and it was a breeze getting it registered with my cellular company. Keeping my fingers crossed that it stays this way 🤞🏻",5
2458,The price is good and works great with Ting. I am very happy with my phone.,5
2459,I just got mine today and the camera is very shaky witch I dislike but other than that I like it,4
2460,It was exactly what I wanted,5
2461,"excellent product, not a single scratch, works perfectly",5
2462,The phone looked like it was in good shape but it did not power on or charge. Tried different chargers and cords known to be good and no change. It would not charge or power on. I called the number listed and they told me to ship it back. Very disappointed.,1
2463,"received package, but no iphone in the box. Inside box is already opened and it has just charger adaptor and charging cable.",1
2464,Excellent phone. No issues detected.Perfect as new!!,5
2465,No issues with phone.  Operates normal. It replaced my older model Apple phone that had a terminal illness. I don’t need all the latest technology and this worked out.,4
2466,I actually bought 2 phones one was like new and the other one Battery life was below 78% and the phone was very dirty even the speaker were blocked so I return it back,1
2467,Got the product in one day. It came in great condition and had no issues setting it up with my Verizon network. Just a simple sim card replacement.,5
2468,The phone came to me with a Battery Health of 80%. Went to local CPR phone repair and they changed out battery for $60.00.,4
2469,Apparently this product comes from some international market that does NOT allow for the shutter to be muted or changed. The noise is particularly loud and effectively renders the camera unusable in public places.,1
2470,I dislike about the phone that u guys didn't check where the Sim card slot don't works,2
2471,Great deal,5
2472,The phone is great and in good condition. The seller was really fast to ship out the phone in which that was very helpful. Would recommend anybody to order from the shipper.,4
2473,Bat life is kinda low but over all good,5
2474,Works good just didn't come with what was listed but they make it right when you call them.  Good price.,4
2475,very good quality,5
2476,Good replacement phone for a good price. No problems with phone at all.,5
2477,Very nicely packed. Phone looks and work like new.,5
2478,Horrible Don’t Buy tried to activate and they said device was defective I’m shipping it back ASAP false advertising when they say it’s fully unlocked it’s not it’s actually locked to ATT,1
2479,Very good,5
2480,"Phone is in nice shape, battery life sucks also the charger they sent melted!!! They were quick to send a replacement charger we are keeping a close eye on it though.",2
2481,The phone takes a long time to launch some applications but overall works fine.I was not expecting this slowness on an iPhone 8.,3
2482,I was scared to buy this with all the bad reviews but the phone itself turned out fine. I dont see any issues and everything is just the way it should be! I'll update my review if anything happens.,5
2483,When I brought this phone to an Apple store they checked it and it had a serious hardware defect.  I sent it back...,1
2484,It blinks unexpectedly from time to time and when that happens I just need to turn it off. Otherwise it works great!,4
2485,Very nice,5
2486,"No good don’t order if you want a phone that actually works👎🏽🚫🛑.Received my phone and it’s still under the owner's Apple ID. A waste of my time. So I bought it as a gift for someone they opened it and tried use it, and it doesn’t even work. They wouldn’t even replace it.",1
2487,"Horrible phone connection. Anyone I call, no matter their service plan, can’t hear a thing I say over the phone. I’ve never had this issue before with a phone. I usually never write reviews but this was really bad.",1
2488,Received the phone in great shape. Works great.,5
2489,My daughter loves her phone came in great condition. Everything works great👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,5
2490,Definitely fully unlocked. Phone works perfectly after purchasing a new SIM card. Thought I could use my old one since it was the same carrier and an iPhone . Only noticeable problems yet so far were finger smudges and a  small scratch on glass.,5
2491,This is the best thing I’ve ever bought. After reading the reviews I was nervous to buy it but when my phone arrived it was practically brand new other than missing the iPhone box! I love it! I got the Silver and it is in perfect condition!,5
2492,"I was skeptical of buying an electronic like an iphone, but it was perfect as if it was never used. I’m very impressed with the product.",5
2493,"Fast shipping, and worked right out of the box. No issues.",5
2494,This was for my Son. He is very happy with his phone,4
2495,The phone looks like new. It does however have a glitch when sending attachments to more than one contact. It freezes and the only way to fix it is by powering off.,3
2496,"Came in just in time, works great nothing broken.",5
2497,the microphone did not work,1
2498,"NOT unlocked like the listing says it is, put in the SIM card only to be told it didn't support the carrier.",1
2499,"We bought this as a replacement for my daughters phone. She loves it! It was easy to set up, fingerprint reader is perfect! Very happy with our purchase from here!!",5
2500,Good,4
2501,"I’m satisfied. Wish it had shown the Size of it rather than going by a #...Wish I had gone with the 8plus Size.If You decide , can you send back and Upgrade to the 8Plus?",5
2502,My back camera did not work when I first received it and it started working after 72 hours then it never worked again. Everything else about the phone was cool.,3
2503,"Phone does not hold charge, battery must be bad.",4
2504,Producto en excelentes condiciones y calidad.,5
2505,This phone was delivered very quickly and is in immaculate condition.  Battery life 84%.  All functions work perfectly so far!,5
2506,...Then it's only good for calling and texting and nothing else works. Don't cheap out on this it's almost $400 down the drain. Now I have to pay full price to buy a new one. I might as well did it in the first place.,1
2507,My daughter loved it,5
2508,"iPhone doesn’t stay charged, even when it’s fully charged and it was say no service and will reboot by itself! Also continues to say a virus had took over the phone",1
2509,Both phones look like they are in great condition. There were just two things I dislike. The chargers are not iphone chargers and the audio on one phone is damaged.,2
2510,Do t yet know the battery life but the phone works great,4
2511,This phone doesn’t work at all,1
2512,"I’ve never in my life cared to write a review, once the phone came in it was in great condition, all that was needed of me was to bring it to a metro store to get it registered. And now I have a perfect iPhone 8 for cheap. I am happy.",5
2513,"The battery is completely dead. The phone is turning off all the time, even its battery charge is over 90%. Is completely useless to have a phone without being able to use it unplugged. Dissapointing",1
2514,It’s a nice and fast iPhone,5
2515,Looks like brand new !,5
2516,Had to send back. Would not charge! Quick return and refund.,2
2517,I like the phone but it is too small,1
2518,cost too much,1
2519,"Phone was generally in good condition. However, the batter dies really fast. From a full charge I would say I have about an hours use before it’s down to 20%.",2
2520,Nope,1
2521,"It works only for one day after that, the screen doesn't work any more.",1
2522,"I’ve never bought refurbished electronics online. Had the tiniest of scratches on the top, battery health was 86%.. but the phone looks great and feels great.. and thats somewhat expected I guess.. I recommend",4
2523,I was very nervous about purchasing this phone used online like this but everything was great. The phone was pretty much brand new and we had zero issues,5
2524,Weird sound home button. No sense make stocking fee. I suggest avoid this seller and product.,1
2525,"Battery life, is bad",3
2526,The phone is stolen and can’t be hooked up are you bought it from a buyer that has a lock on it so no good,1
2527,Buen producto,5
2528,Battery doesn’t work.,1
2529,Phone was okay. They shipped it with a third party charger that didn’t work consistently after a few months and caused my elderly mom untold anguish and anxiety. I’m not kidding! Quit skimping on the F*ing charger.,2
2530,I can’t hear my callers,1
2531,It works pretty good,5
2532,Great little phone,5
2533,It was an iPhone 8 as advertised. Very happy it wasn’t a scam 👍 bought it to trade into att for my new phone and everything checked out. Good deal,5
2534,"Nice phone, high quality, fast ship, packed well.",5
2535,It was in perfect condition. Everything functional.,5
2536,"The phone is fine and works as it should, but the battery will stay charged about 2 hours from 💯% to dead-as-doornail. I need this rectified as this is my primary way to do business. Not acceptable! Please contact me.",3
2537,"Phone was not unlocked, as advertised.  Had to return.  Disappointed by misinformation but grateful to have received a full refund.Bought new at TMobile and it wasnt much more expensive than this phone.  Would recommend going that route instead.",1
2538,IT WORKS IN JAMAICA,5
2539,"Llego perfecto, batería 100% sin duda algunas tuve nervios por comentarios pero el envió llego antes de lo previsto y todo excelente, sin duda alguna lo compraría de nuevo, muchas gracias!!Desbloqueado para Peru.",5
2540,"Phone was in good co diction, however the battery was terrible. Will not hold a charge and now will not even charge. Not worth $200.",1

2546,Worked as expected.,5
2547,Phone works GREAT and fast shipping,5
2548,"Everything about this phone is amazing. The battery life is not the best, but the phone came with a screen protector already on it. The seller does a phenomenal job. Thus product is good.",5
2549,"Came and wouldn't even turn on, contacting the seller resulted in silence. Lots of places to get refurbished phones, make sure this isn't one of the places you do.",1
2550,Always a hit or miss with refurbished products. I bought 2 phones & both have been working very well for the past 6 months.,5
2551,EVERTHING I was hoping it would be I definitely would recommend buying a phone form them came wayyyyy faster then planes and everything worked great place to buy from,5
2552,"for the price , not bad came with only a charger and the edges of the phone have peel marks and . overall, the phone is work and the battery life is ok",5
2553,"Took a while to get it to transfer over, everything is perfect 👌",5
2554,My camera did not work tried to reboot it like they told me when I returned it they kept $32.02 of my money for a defective phone that they sent to me I do not recommend this people at all. I give them negative stars,1
2555,Sound quality is terrible!,3
2556,Very disappointed. The battery life is very poor. And when I checked the battery capacity it was under 80%. Less than what they advertised. If you buy . Please be aware of this.,1
2557,Worked great for a few months then once the return time was over the cellular stopped working sporadically and it glitches often.,1
2558,The lcd screen  on this phone is unresponsive. It happens at least once a day. The brightness will lower on its own. Very poor refurbished iPhone,1
2559,Great Product!!,5
2560,Short battery life. Doesn’t last even a few hours. Other than that works ok.,4
2561,It wont let me set up an apple ID the phone. I can only use it on wifi.,1

2578,Work perfectly! Got this for my son as a replacement... no issues great condition,5
2579,The only thing I have a problem with is that when I get a call I can’t hear the person on the other end of the phone its very low I tried to adjust the volume but that didn’t do anything,4
2580,IT works like new.  It is only a week old but so far so good.,5
2581,Upon taking the phone out of the box I noticed there was debris under the plastic which leads me to believe the phone may not have been cleaned. Also there’s noticeable redness in the camera flash circle on the back of the phone. Water damage??? I just hope the phone lasts,3

2665,Terrible battery life. Charges fast. People only hear me via Bluetooth and speaker,4
2666,"WRONG CARRIER and it specifically said AT&T/T-MOBILE. When I got it, it wouldn't accept my T-Mobile sim card. Had to pay another $8 dollars to send it back, just to not receive a refund. Waste of time and waste of $300 down the drain!",1

2752,"I guess it’s  best to get Apple certified refurbished iPhones. This one can’t get a photo or video, or even make a phone call, for very long without shutting down. (Not like a standard crash that returns you to the home screen—instead, the phone just powers off.)",1
2753,My phone telling me I have 50 gb storage not 64 confused,1
